1   ELECTRIC FORCE AND
ELECTRIC FIELD
Your goals for this chapter are to learn about electric forces and electric fields.
1.1                                                                                                 ELECTRIC FORCE
Experiment shows that when fur and rubber are rubbed together, they develop the property
of attracting each other. Tis kind of force that arises after objects are rubbed together is
called electrical force. Te change that took place during the rubbing process that is responsible
for this force is called charge.
Experiment also shows that when another set of rubber and fur are rubbed together, the
two furs repel and the two rubbers repel each other. Tis indicates that there must be two
kinds of charges because one object can attract one kind of charge and repel another kind of
charge. Tese two kinds of charge are mathematically identified as positive and negative. It
is safe to assume that the two furs have the same kind of charge and the two rubbers have
the same charge. Terefore it follows that similar charges repel and opposite charges attract.
According to the current understanding of charges, charges are the result of the transfer of
electrons from one object to another when the objects are rubbed together. Electrons are
negatively charged. Tus, the object that gained electrons becomes negatively charged and
the object that lost electrons becomes positively charged.
Te unit of measurement for charge is the Coulomb, abbreviated as C. Te charge of an
electron in Coulombs is equal to -1.6e-19 C. Te charge of a proton is numerically equal
to that of the electron but is positive; that is the charge of a proton is 1.6e-19 C. Charge
is measured by an instrument called electroscope. An electroscope consists of a pair of gold
leaves in a jar. When the gold leaves are brought in contact with a charged object, both
leaves acquire the same charge and they repel each other. As a result the leaves deflect. Te
deflection angle is proportional to the amount of charge. Tus, charge can be measured by
measuring the deflection angle.

Tere are two methods by which a neutral object can be charged. Tese are conduction and
induction. Conduction is a process by which a neutral object is brought in direct contact
with a charged object. In the process, the neutral object acquires the same kind of charge
as the charging object. Induction is a process by which a neutral object is brought closer
(without touching) to a charged object and then grounded (connected to the ground). In
this process, the neutral object acquires opposite charge to that of the charging object.
Substances with free electrons are called conductors. Conductors are good conductors
of electricity and heat. Tey are shiny and ductile (their shape can be changed without
breaking). Tese are generally metals. Substances without free electrons are called insulators.
Insulators are bad conductors of electricity and heat. Tey are dull and brittle (difficult to
change shape without breaking). Examples are wood and glass.

Coulomb’s law states that any two charges exert electrical force on each other that is
proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance separating them. Te direction of the force is along the line joining the centers of
the charges. It is attractive if the charges are opposite and is repulsive if the charges have
similar charges.
F = k|q1||q2| ⁄ r 2
F is the magnitude of the electrical force exerted by one on the other. q1 and q2 are the
charges of the two objects. r is the distance between the charged objects. k is a universal
constant called Coulomb’s constant. Its value is 9e9 Nm 2 ⁄ C 2.
k = 9e9 Nm 2 ⁄ C 2
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Object A and Object B are separated by a distance of 0.8 m as shown. Charge A
has a charge of -2 µC. Object B has a charge of 4 µC.

a) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the electrical force exerted by object A on
object B.
Solution: Since A and B have opposite charges, the force is attractive. Terefore the direction
of the force exerted by object A on object B is west (left).
qA = -2 µC = -2e-6 C; qB = 4 µC = 4e-6 C; r = 0.8 m; FBA = ?

b) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the electrical force exerted by object B
on object A.
Solution: Te force exerted by object B on object A and the force exerted by object A on
object B are action reaction forces; that is they have equal magnitudes and opposite directions.
Terefore the direction of the force exerted by object B on object A is east (right).
FBA = 11.25 N; FAB = ?
FAB = FBA = 11.25 N

Te superposition principle for electric forces states that if a charge is in a vicinity of a number
of charges, the net electric force acting on the charge is the vector sum of all the forces
exerted on the charge by the individual charges. If charges q1 , q2 , … , qn are in the vicinity
of a charge q, then the net force acting on the charge (Fnet) is given by
Fnet = F1 + F2 + … + Fn
where F1, F2 … Fn are the forces exerted by the charges q1, q2 … qn.

Te horizontal (vertical) component of the sum of vectors is equal to the sum of the
horizontal (vertical) components of the vectors being added; that is if R = A + B + … , then
Rx = Ax + Bx + …
Ry = Ay + By + …
Te magnitude and direction of the sum vector in terms of the components of the vectors
being added are given as follows:
R = √{( Ax + Bx + …) 2 + (Ay + By + …) 2 }
θ = arctan {( Ay + By + …) ⁄ (Ax + Bx + … )}
If Ax + Bx + … < 0, 180° should be added to θ.
If a vector A makes an angle θ with the positive x-axis, then the horizontal and vertical
components of the vector are given by Ax = A cos (θ) and Ay = A sin (θ).
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Consider the charged objects shown in the figure below. Object A has a charge
of 5 nC. Object B has a charge of -3 nC. Object C has a charge of 2 nC.

a) Determine the magnitude and direction of the electrical force exerted by object A
on object C.
Solution: Since object A and B have similar charges (positive), the force between them is
repulsive. Terefore the force exerted by A on C is east (right).
qA = 5 nC = 5e-9 C ; qC = 2 nC = 2e-9 C ; rAC = 1 mm = 1e-3 m ; FCA = ?
FCA = k|qA ||qC| ⁄ rAC 2 = 9e9 * 5e-9 * 2e-9 ⁄ (1e-3) 2 N = 0.09 N

c) Determine the magnitude and direction of the net electrical force exerted on C
by A and B.
Solution: According to the superposition principle, the net force exerted on C is the
vector sum of the forces exerted by A and B: Te two forces have the same line of action
(horizontal) and are opposite in direction. Tus the net force is the difference between
the two forces and takes the direction of the bigger force. Te bigger force is force due
to B. Terefore the net force will take the direction of the force due to B which is west.
Fnet = (FCB - FCA) west = (0.15 - 0.09) N west = 0.06 N west.

B has a charge of -2 µC and Object C has a charge of 3 µC.

a) For the electrical force exerted by object A on object B
i. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force.
Solution: Since both objects have similar charges, the force exerted by A on B is
repulsive. Te angle formed between this force and the positive x-axis (horizontal
line to the right of B) is numerically equal to the angle formed at B in the
right angled triangle formed by A, B and the origin (because they are vertically
opposite angles). Also the angle should be negative because it is measured in a
clockwise direction from the positive x-axis. Terefore this angle can be calculated
from the sides of the right angled triangle formed by the origin, A and B.

Te force between charges can also be described in terms of fields by making use of field
theory. Field theory states that a charge sets up electric field throughout space and this
electric field exerts force on a charge placed at any point in space.
Electric field (E) at a given point is defined to be electric force (F) per a unit charge exerted
on a charge (q) placed at the given point.
E = F ⁄ q
Tis is a vector equation. When the charge is positive the force and the field have the same
direction; and when the charge is negative they have opposite directions. A relationship
between the magnitudes of the electric force and electric field can be obtained equating the
magnitudes of sides of the equation.
F = |q|E
F is the magnitude of the force exerted on a charge q placed at a point where the magnitude
of the electric field is E. Te unit of measurement for electric field is N ⁄ C.
Electric field at a certain point can be determined experimentally, by putting a small positive
test charge on the point and then measuring the electric force acting on it. Te electric field
is obtained as the ratio between the magnitude of the force and the charge. Te direction
of the field will be the same as the direction of the force because the test charge is positive.

Example: Determine the magnitude and direction of an electric field at a certain point
a) if a 4 C charge placed at the point experiences a force of 100 N north.
Solution: Since the charge is positive, the electric field should have the same direction as
the force which is north.
q = 4 C; F = 100 N; E = ?
E = F ⁄ |q| = 100 ⁄ 4 N ⁄ C = 25 N ⁄ C
E = 25 N ⁄ C north
_______________________________________________________________________
b) if a -5 C placed at the point experiences a force of 20 N west.
Solution: Since the charge is negative the direction of the electric field is opposite to that
of the force. Te direction of the force is west. Terefore the direction of the electric field
must be east.
q = -5 C; F = 20 N; E = ?
E = F ⁄ |q| = 20 ⁄ |-5| N ⁄ C = 4 N ⁄ C
E = 4 N ⁄ C east
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Te electric field at a certain point is 20 N ⁄ C south.
a) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the electric force acting on a -2 C charge
placed at the point.
Solution: Since the charge is negative, the direction of the force is opposite to that of the
field. Te direction of the field is south. Terefore the direction of the force must be north.

1.7                                                                                               ELECTRIC FIELD DUE TO A POINT CHARGE
Consider a small positive charge qo placed a distance r from a point charge q. Suppose
the magnitude of the force acting on the test charge by the point charge is F. Ten the
magnitude of the electric field at the location of the test charge is given by E = F ⁄ qo.
But according to Coulomb’s law, the force exerted by q on qo is given as F = k|q|qo ⁄ r 2.
Terefore the magnitude of the electric field due to a point charge q, at a distance r from
the point charge is given as follows:
E = k|q| ⁄ r 2
Te direction of the field is the same as the direction of the force exerted on a positive
charge placed at the point. Tus if the point charge is positive, since the direction of the
force exerted on a positive charge placed at the point is repulsive, the direction of the field
is away from the point charge along the line joining the point charge and the point. And
if the point charge is negative, since the force on a positive charge placed at the point is
attractive, the direction of the field is towards the point charge along the line joining the
point charge and the point.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Consider the diagram shown. Object A has a charge of -5 nC. Calculate the
magnitude and direction of the electric field at point P.
Figure 1.4
Solution: Since the charge is negative, the direction of the electric field is directed towards
the charge along the line joining the point and the charge. Tus the direction of the electric
field at point P is west.
q = -5 nC = -5e-9 C; r = 0.8 m; E = ?
E = k|q| ⁄ r 2 = 9e9 * 5e-9 ⁄ 0.8 2 N ⁄ C = 70.3 N ⁄ C
E = 70.3 N ⁄ C west

Te superposition principle for electric field states that if there are a number of charges in
the vicinity of a point, then the net electric field at the point is the vector sum of all the
electric fields due to the individual charges. If charges q1, q2 … qn. are in the vicinity of a
point, then the net electric field (Enet) is given as
Enet = E1 + E2 + … + En
where E1, E2 … En are electric fields due to charges q1, q2 … qn respectively.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Consider the diagram shown below. Object A has a charge of -6 nC. Object B has
a charge of 4 nC. Determine the magnitude and direction of the net electric field at point P.
Figure 1.5
Solution: Te net electric field at point P is the vector sum of the electric fields due to
objects A and B. Since the charge of A is negative, the direction of the electric field at point
P is directed towards itself; and thus its direction is north. Since charge B is positive, the
direction of the electric field at point P due to B is directed away from B; that is its direction
is north. Since both fields have the same direction, the net field has the same direction
as both (north) and its magnitude is obtained by adding the magnitudes of both vectors.
qA = -6 nC = -6e-9 C ; rA = 0.5 m ; qB = 4 nC = 4e-9 C ; rB = 0.5 m ; Enet = EA + EB = ?
EA = k|qA | ⁄ rA 2 = 9e9 * 6e-9 ⁄ 0.5 2 N ⁄ C = 216 N ⁄ C

EA = 216 N ⁄ C north
EB = k|qB | ⁄ rB 2 = 9e9 * 4e-9 ⁄ 0.5 2 N ⁄ C = 144 N ⁄ C
EB = 144 N ⁄ C north

Example: Consider the charges shown. Object A has a charge -8 nC. Object B has a charge
of 3 nC.
Figure 1.6
a) Calculate the horizontal and vertical components of the net electric field at point P.
Solution: Since the charge of A is negative the direction of the electric field at point P due
to A is directed towards A. Te default angle for this vector (angle with respect to the
horizontal line to the right) can be obtained by subtracting the angle formed at point P
in the right angled triangle formed by A, P and the origin from 180 °. Since the charge
of B is positive the direction of the electric field at point P due to B is directed away from
B. Te default angle for this vector is equal to the angle formed at point P in the right
angled triangle formed by B, P and the origin.
qA = -8 nC = -8e-9 C ; rAP = √( 0.4² + 0.6²) m = 0.72 m ; θA = 180° - arctan (0.4 ⁄ 0.6)
= 146.3° ; qB = 3 nC = 3e-9 C ; rBP = √( 0.5² + 0.6²) m = 0.78 m ; θB = arctan (0.5 ⁄ 0.6)
= 39.8° ; Enetx = EAx + EBx = ? ; Enety = EAy + EBy = ?
EA = k|qA | ⁄ rAp 2 = 9e9 * 8e-9 ⁄ 0.72 2 N ⁄ C = 138.9 N ⁄ C
EB = k|qB | ⁄ rBp 2 = 9e9 * 3e-9 ⁄ 0.78 2 N ⁄ C = 44.4 N ⁄ C

= 105.5 N ⁄ C
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the net electric field at point P.
Solution: Enet = ? ; θnet = ?
Enet = √(Enetx 2 + Enety 2) = √((-81.4) 2 + 105.5 2) N ⁄ C = 133.3 N ⁄ C

Electric field lines are lines used to represent electric field. Since electric field is a vector
quantity, electric field lines should represent both magnitude and direction of the field. Te
magnitude of the field is represented by the number of lines per a unit perpendicular area
(density of lines). Te number of lines per a unit perpendicular area is drawn in such a way
that it is proportional to the magnitude of the field. Te line of action of the field at a point
on a line is represented by the line tangent to the curve at the given point. To distinguish
between the two possible directions of the tangent line, an arrow is put on the lines.
Electric field lines originate in a positive charge and sink in a negative charge somewhere.
Te arrows are directed from the positive charge towards the negative charge. Electric field
lines cannot cross each other. Because if they do, that would mean two tangent lines or to
two directions at the intersection point and there can’t be two directions for a given field.
1.10 ELECTRIC FIELD LINES DUE TO POINT CHARGES
Te electric field lines due to a positive point charge (Assuming the negative charge is at infinity)
originate from the positive charge (the arrows are directed away from the charge) and spread
out radially. Te following diagram shows electric field lines due to a positive point charge.

2   ELECTRICAL ENERGY
AND CAPACITANCE
Your goals for this chapter are to learn about electrical energy, potential difference and capacitors.

Te work (We) done by an electrical force in displacing a charge q is equal to the product
of the magnitude of the electrical force (Fe), the magnitude of the displacement (d), and
the cosine of the angle (θ) between the force and the displacement. Te magnitude of the
force is equal to the product of the absolute value of the charge and the magnitude of the
electric field (E).
We = |q|Ed cos (θ)
If the electrical force and the displacement are parallel, then θ = 0 and We = |q|Ed.

Electrical force is a conservative force. Te work done by electrical force is independent of
the path followed. It depends only on the electrical potential energies at the initial and final
position. It is equal to the negative of the change in its potential energy.
We = - ΔPEe = - (PEef - PEei)
PEei and PEef are the electrical potential energies at the initial and final locations respectively.
If electrical force is the only force with non-zero contribution to the work done, then
mechanical energy is conserved and the following equations hold.
KEi + PEei = KEf + PEef
ΔKE = - ΔPEe
KEi and KEf are the kinetic energies at the initial and final locations respectively. ΔKE and ΔPEe are
equal to (KEf - KEi) and (PEef - PEei) respectively. Since kinetic energy of an object of mass
m and speed v is given as mv 2 ⁄ 2, these equations can be rewritten as follows.
mvi 2 ⁄ 2 + PEei = mvf 2 ⁄ 2 + PEef
mvf 2 ⁄ 2 - mvi 2 ⁄ 2 = - ΔPEe
vi and vf are the initial and final velocities respectively.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Te electric field between two oppositely charged parallel plates is perpendicular
to the plates and is uniform. Te magnitude of the electric field is 50 N ⁄ C. Te plates
are separated by a distance 0.002 m. A proton (charge = 1.6e-19 C, mass= 1.67e-27 kg) is
released from rest at the negative plate.
a) Calculate the work done by the electric force in displacing the proton from the
positive plate to the negative plate.
Solution: Since the charge is positive, the electric force and the electric field are parallel.
Terefore the electric force is directed from the positive plate to the negative plate
perpendicularly. Te displacement of the proton is also from the positive plate to the
negative plate perpendicularly (because it is repelled by the positive plate and attracted
by the negative plate). Tus the angle between the force and the displacement is zero.

Te unit of measurement for potential difference is J ⁄ C which is defined to be the Volt
and abbreviated as V. For two oppositely charged parallel plates, since |ΔPEe | = |q|Ed and
|ΔV| = |ΔPEe ⁄ q|, the absolute value of the potential difference between the plates is the
product of the magnitude of the electric field and their separation.
|ΔV| = Ed
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: 4 mJ of energy is required to transport a 3 µ C charge (with uniform velocity)
between two points. Calculate the potential difference between the points.
Solution: Since it is transported with a uniform velocity, the work done by the external
force to transport it and the work done by the electrical force must be numerically equal.
q = 3 µC = 3e-6 C; ΔPEe = 4 mJ = 4e-3 J; ΔV = ?
ΔV = ΔPEe ⁄ q = 4e-3 ⁄ 3e-6 V = 1.3e3 V

Example: Te electric field between two parallel oppositely charged plates separated by a distance
of 0.004 m has a magnitude of 15 N ⁄ C. Calculate the potential difference between the plates.
Solution: E = 15 N ⁄ C; d = 0.004 m; ΔV = ?

Example: Calculate
a) the speed of a proton (charge = 1.6e-19 C; mass = 1.67e-27 kg) accelerated (from
rest) through a potential difference of 100 V.
Solution: If electrical force is the only force acting on a positive charge, it is displaced towards
lower potential (less positive or more negative) regions; that is, the potential difference of
a positive charge under the influence of electrical force only should be negative.
q = 1.6e-19 C; ΔV = -100 V; vi = 0; m = 1.67e-27 kg; vf = ?
mvf 2 ⁄ 2 - mvi 2 ⁄ 2 = - ΔPEe = - qΔV
vf 2 = - 2qΔV ⁄ m
vf = √(- 2qΔV ⁄ m) = √(-2 * 1.6e-19 * -100 ⁄ 1.67e-27) m ⁄ s = 138426 m ⁄ s
_______________________________________________________________________
b) the speed of an electron (charge = -1.6e-19 C; mass = 9.1e-31 kg) accelerated (from
rest) through a potential difference of 100 V.
Solution: If electrical force is the only force acting on a negative charge, it is displaced
towards higher potential (more positive or less negative) regions; that is, the potential
difference of a negative charge under the influence of electrical force only should be positive.
q = -1.6e-19 C; ΔV = 100 V; vi = 0; m = 9.1e-31 kg; vf = ?
mvf 2 ⁄ 2 - mvi 2 ⁄ 2 = - ΔPEe = - qΔV
vf 2 = - 2qΔV ⁄ m
vf = √(- 2qΔV ⁄ m) = √(-2 * -1.6e-19 * 100 ⁄ 9.1e-31) m ⁄ s = 5929995 m ⁄ s

Te electron volt (eV) is a unit of energy defined to be equal to the amount of energy
required to accelerate an electron through a potential difference of one volt. Terefore it is
equal to to the product of the charge of an electron and one volt which is equal to 1.6e-19 J.
eV = 1.6e-19 J
Electron volt is suitable for atomic physics because energies encountered in atomic physics
are of the order of eV. For example, the ground state energy of the electron of a hydrogen
atom is 13.6 eV.

Example: How many Joules are there in 50 eV?
Solution:
eV = 1.6e-19 J
1.6e-19 J ⁄ eV = 1
50 eV = 50 eV * (1.6e-19 J ⁄ eV) = 50 * 1.6e-19 J = 50 * 1.6e-19 J = 8e-18 J

Electric potential at a certain point is defined to be its potential difference with respect to a
certain reference point where the potential is defined to be zero. Te choice of a reference
point is arbitrary. Te reference point for the electric potential due to a point charge is
usually taken to be at infinity. Te potential of a point located a distance r from a point
charge q with respect to infinity is given by the following equation.
V = kq ⁄ r
Where k is Coulombs constant (k = 9e9 Nm² ⁄ C²). Electric potential due to a point charge
can be positive or negative depending on whether the charge is positive or negative.

Superposition Principle for electric potential states that if there are a number of charges in the
vicinity of a point, then the net potential at the point is the algebraic sum of the potentials
due to the individual charges. If charges q1, q2, …, qn are in the vicinity of a point, then
the net potential, Vnet, at the point is given by
Vnet = V1 + V2 + … + Vn
Where V1, V2, …,Vn are potentials due to charges q1, q2, …, qn respectively.

2.5   ELECTRIC POTENTIAL ENERGY STORED BY TWO
POINT CHARGES
Work is required to separate a positive and a negative charge (because they attract each other)
or to bring similar charges closer (because they repel each other). Tis means there is energy
stored by charges in the vicinity of each other equal to the work required to bring them to
their locations. Te energy stored by two charges separated by a certain distance is equal to
the amount of work required to bring one of the charges form infinity to its location. Te
energy stored by two charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is equal to the amount of
work required to bring the charge q2 from infinity to its location. Te work required to bring
q2 from infinity to its location is equal to q2 (V2 - V∞). Te potential at infinity, V∞, is zero
because infinity is the reference point for potentials due to point charges. V2 is the potential
at the location of q2 due to q1 and is equal to kq1 ⁄ r. Terefore the energy (U) stored by two
charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given as follows:
U = kq1q2 ⁄ r
Te energy stored is positive if they have the same charges and negative if they are
opposite charges.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Calculate the electrical energy stored by a 3 µC charge and a -9 µC charge separated
by a distance of 0.006 m.
Solution: q1 = 3 µC = 3e-6 C; q2 = -9 µC = -9e-6 C; r = 0.006 m; U = ?
U = kq1q2 ⁄ r = 9e9 * 3e-6 * -9e-6 ⁄ 0.006 J = -40 J

A Conductor is said to be in electrostatic equilibrium if its free charges are at rest. Te
electric field inside such a conductor must be zero because if was not zero, the free charges
would be moving. Te work done in transporting a charge from one point inside such a
conductor to another point must be zero because We = |q|Ed cos (θ) and E = 0. And since
the work done in taking a charge from one point to another is zero, it follows that all the
points in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium must be at the same potential because
ΔV = ΔPEe ⁄ q = - We ⁄ q and We = 0. Te work done in moving a charge along the surface
of the conductor is zero because all the points on the surface are at the same potential. Tis
implies that the electric field just outside a conductor must be perpendicular to the surface,
because for displacements along the surface We = |q|Ed cos (θ) = 0 which is possible only
if cos (θ) = 0 or θ = 90°.
2.7                                                                                                 EQUIPOTENTIAL SURFACES
An equipotential surface is a surface whose points are all at the same potential. Tus, no work
is required in transporting a charge from one point to another point of an equipotential
surface. Electric field lines and equipotential surfaces must be perpendicular to each other,
because the work along an equipotential surface can be zero only if the electric field is
perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces.

A capacitor is two conductors separated by an insulator. A capacitor is used to store charges
or electrical energy. When a capacitor is connected to a potential difference, electrons are
transferred from one of the conductor to the other and both conductors acquire equal but
opposite charges. Te charge accumulated by a capacitor is directly proportional to the
potential difference between the plates. Te constant of proportionality (ratio) between the
charge and the potential difference is called the capacitance (C) of the capacitor.

Q represents the charge accumulated by the capacitor and ΔV stands for the potential
difference between the two conductors of the capacitor. Te unit of measurement for
capacitance is C ⁄ V which is defined to be the Farad and abbreviated as F. Te following
diagram shows the circuit symbol for a capacitor.

Te capacitance of a capacitor depends only on the geometry of the capacitor. For example
the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor depends only on the area of the plates and
the separation between the plates. Te capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is directly
proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between
the plates.
C|| = εo A ⁄ d
C|| is the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor (in vacuum or approximately air) of area A
separated by a distance d. εo is a universal constant called electrical permittivity of vacuum.
It is related with Coulomb’s constant as εo = 1 ⁄ (4πk). Its value is 8.85e-12 F ⁄ m.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Te plates of a parallel plate capacitor have an area of 0.0002 m². Te two plates
are separated by a distance of 0.03 m. If the capacitor is in air, calculate its capacitance.
Solution: A = 0.0002 m²; d = 0.03 m; C|| = ?
C|| = εo A ⁄ d = 8.8-12 * 0.0002 ⁄ 0.03 F = 5.9e-14 F

2.10 ELECTRICAL ENERGY STORED BY A CAPACITOR
When the two conductors of a charged capacitor are connected by a conducting wire, charges
will flow from one of the conductors to the other which indicates that there is stored electrical
energy in a charged capacitor. As a capacitor is charged, the potential difference between
the plates will increase linearly. Tis means the charges are not being transported through a
constant potential difference. For a certain small charge dQ the change in potential energy
(which is equal to the energy stored by the capacitor) is equal to the product of the charge
dQ and the potential difference ΔV across which it was transported. Tus the energy (dU)
stored in transporting this charge is given as dU = dQΔV. Tese contributions from all the
charges transported should be added to get the total energy stored. Tis sum can be obtained
from the graph of potential difference versus charge as the area enclosed between the potential
difference versus charge curve and the charge axis. Since the graph is linear, the total energy
is equal to the area of a right angled triangle of base Q (total charge stored) and height ΔV
(potential difference corresponding to the charge Q).
U = QΔV ⁄ 2

U stands for electrical energy stored by a capacitor of charge Q and potential difference ΔV.
An expression for U in terms of capacitance and potential difference can be obtained by
replacing Q by CΔV.
U = CΔV 2 ⁄ 2
Also, it can be expressed in terms of capacitance and charge by replacing ΔV by Q ⁄ C.
U = Q 2 ⁄ (2C)

of 6 V
Solution: C = 2 µF = 2e-6 F; ΔV = 6 V; U = ?

Te parts of each capacitor that are connected by conducting wires are at the same potential
because there is no potential drop across a conducting wire. Tis means capacitors connected
in parallel have the same potential difference which is also equal to the total potential
difference across the combination.
ΔV = ΔV1 = ΔV2 = ΔV3 = …
ΔV1, ΔV2, ΔV3 … are the potential differences across capacitors C1, C2, C3, … connected in
parallel. ΔV is the potential difference across the combination. Te total charge accumulated
by capacitors in parallel is equal to the sum of the charges of the individual capacitors.
Q = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + …
Q1, Q2, Q3, … are charges accumulated by capacitors C1, C2, C3, … connected in parallel.
Q is the total charge accumulated by the combination.
Equivalent Capacitance of (Ceq) a combination of capacitors is the single capacitor that can
replace the combination with the same effect. It is equal to the ratio between the total charge
of the combination and the total potential difference across the combination.
Ceq = Q ⁄ ΔV

2.13 PARALLEL-SERIES COMBINATION OF CAPACITORS
If a combination involves a number of parallel and series combinations, the combination
can be simplified by replacing each parallel or series combination by its equivalent capacitor.
Tis process can be repeated on the resulting combination again and again until the whole
combination is represented by a single equivalent capacitor.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: An 8 µF capacitor and a 5 µF capacitors are connected in parallel and this
combination is connected in series with a 2 µF capacitor. Ten the whole combination is
connected to a potential difference of 8 V.
a) Calculate the equivalent capacitance of the combination.
Solution: First the equivalent capacitance (C1,2) of the capacitors connected in parallel
should be obtained. Ten this equivalent capacitance should be combined in series with
the capacitance of the third capacitor.
C1 = 8 µF = 8e-6 F; C2 = 5 µF = 5e-6 F; C3 = 2 µF = 2e-6 F; Ceq = ?
C1,2 = C1 + C2 = (8e-6 + 5e-6) F = 13e-6 F
Ceq = C1,2 C3 ⁄ (C1,2 + C3) = 13e-6 * 2e-6 ⁄ (13e-6 + 2e-6) F = 1.73e-6 F
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Calculate the total charge stored by the combin ation.
Solution: ΔV = 8 V; Q = ?
Q = Ceq ΔV = 1.73e-6 * 8 C = 14e-6 C
c) Calculate the charge across the 2 µF capacitor.
Solution: Te 2 µF capacitor and the equivalent capacitor of the capacitors in parallel are
in series. Terefore the charge of the 2 F capacitor should be equal to the total charge.
Q3 = ?
Q = Q1,2 = Q = 14e-6 C

F capacitor and a parallel combination of a 6 F and 8 F capacitors.

C1 = 2 F; C2 = 5 F; C3 = 6 F; C4 = 8 F; C</eq = ?
C3,4 = C3 + C4 = (6 + 8) F = 14 F

Your goals for this chapter are to learn about current, resistance, relationship between current
and potential difference, and electrical power.
3.1                                                                                                CURRENT

that the potential difference (ΔV) across a resistor is directly proportional to the current
through the resistor. Te constant of proportionality between the potential difference and
the current (ratio between potential difference and current) is called the resistance of the
resistor and is denoted by R.

Te resistance (Rl) of a wire depends on its length (l) and its cross-sectional area (A). It
is directly proportional to the length of the wire and inversely proportional to the cross-
sectional area of the wire.
Rl = ρl ⁄ A
ρ is a material constant called the resistivity of the material. Te unit of measurement for
resistivity is Ωm.

Example: A silver wire has a length of 5 m and a cross-sectional radius of 0.002 m. Silver
has a resistivity of 1.59e-8 Ωm. It is connected to a potential difference of 0.006 V.
a) Calculate the resistance of the wire.

Resistivity of a material increases with increase of temperature, because temperature increases
the kinetic energy of the particles. Change in resistivity (Δρ) due to change of temperature
is directly proportional to the change in temperature (ΔT) and to the original resistivity
(ρo) of the material.
Δρ = α ρo ΔT
α is a material constant called temperature coefficient of resistivity. Its unit of measurement
is                                                                                                1 ⁄ °C. Δρ = ρ - ρo and ΔT = T - To where ρ is resistivity at a temperature T and ρo
is resistivity at a temperature To. Replacing Δρ by ρ - ρo and ΔT by T - To, the following
expression for the resistivity ρ at a temperature T can be obtained.
ρ = ρo {1 + α(T - To)}
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Silver has a resistivity of 1.59e-8 Ωm at a temperature of 20 °C. Its temperature
coefficient for resistivity is 3.8e-3 1 ⁄ °C.
a) Calculate the resistivity of silver at a temperature of 40 °C.
Solution: T                                                                                       = 20 °C; T = 40 °C; ρo = 1.59e-8 Ωm; α = 3.8e-3 1 ⁄ °C; ρ = ?
o
ρ = ρo {1 + α(T - To)} = 1.59e-8 * {1 + 3.8e-3 * (40 - 20)} Ωm = 1.7e-8 Ωm
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Calculate the change in its resistivity when the temperature changes by 60 °C.
Solution: ΔT = 60 °C; Δρ = ?
Δρ = α ρo ΔT = 1.59e-8 * 3.8e-3 * 60 Ωm = 4e-9 Ωm

Change in resistance (ΔR) due to change in temperature is directly proportional to change
in temperature and to the original resistance (Ro) of the resistor.
ΔR = α Ro ΔT
Once again, α is a material constant called the temperature coefficient of resistivity.
ΔR = R - Ro and ΔT = T - To where R is resistance at a temperature T and Ro is resistance
at a temperature To. Replacing ΔR by R - Ro and ΔT by T - To, the following expression
for the resistance R at a temperature T can be obtained.
R = Ro {1 + α(T - To)}
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A resistor has a resistance of 200 Ω at a temperature of 20 °C. It is made up of
a material whose temperature coefficient for resistivity is 3e-3 1 ⁄ °C. Calculate the current
through the resistor when it is connected to a potential difference of 20 V
a) at a temperature of 20 °C.
Solution: R20 = 200 Ω; ΔV = 20 V; I20 = ?
ΔV = R20 I20
I20 = ΔV ⁄ R20 = 20 ⁄ 200 A = 0.1 A

Te unit of measurement for power is J ⁄ s which is defined to be the Watt, abbreviated as
W. Te change in potential energy of a charge Q that crosses a resistor of potential difference
ΔV is given as ΔPEe = QΔV. Tus the power dissipated in a resistor is given by P = QΔV ⁄ t.
But Q ⁄ t = I. Terefore power dissipated in a resistor is equal to the product of the potential
difference across the resistor and the current through the resistor.

An expression in terms of current and resistance can be obtained by replacing ΔV by IR.
P = I 2R
An expression in terms of potential difference and resistance can be obtained by replacing
I by ΔV ⁄ R.
P = ΔV 2 ⁄ R
Kilo Watt hour (Kwh) is a unit of energy defined to be equal to the energy dissipated in one
hour by a resistor whose power is 1 kW. Tus, 1 KWh is equal to 1000 * 3600 J.

Your goals for this chapter are to learn about electromotive force, combination of resistors
and Kirchoff’s rules.
Tere are two types of circuits. Tey are direct current (dc) circuits and alternating current
(ac) circuits. A dc circuit is a circuit where the current or the voltage are constant in time.
An ac circuit is a circuit where the voltage or the current vary with time typically like a
sine or a cosine.

A source is a device that converts non electrical energy to electrical energy. Examples are a
battery and a hydroelectric generator. A battery converts chemical energy to electrical energy. A
hydroelectric generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. Te following diagram
shows the circuit symbol for a dc source. Te longer line represents the positive terminal and
the shorter line represents the negative terminal.

Figure 4.1
Te amount of work done per a unit charge by a source in transporting a charge from one of
its terminals to the other is called the electromotive force (abbreviated as emf) of the source.
Ε = Ws ⁄ q
Where Ε is the emf of a source and Ws is work done by a source in transporting a charge
q from one of its terminals to the other. Te unit of measurement for emf of a source is
the Volt. Any source has its own internal resistance. Te potential difference between the
terminals of a source is less than the emf of the source, because some of its emf is dropped
across its own internal resistance. If a current I is flowing across a source, the potential
difference across its own resistance r is equal to Ir. Hence the potential difference (ΔVs)
across the terminal of a source is equal to the difference between its emf and the potential
drop across its own internal resistance.
ΔVs = Ε - Ir
If a source is connected to an external resistance R, the potential difference across the external
resistance (IR) is equal to the potential difference across the terminals of the source; that is
ΔVs = Ε - Ir = IR. And solving for the current
I = Ε ⁄ (R + r)
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A battery of emf 20 V and internal resistance 2 Ω is connected to an external
resistance of 48 Ω
a) Calculate the current in the circuit.
Solution: Ε = 20 V; r = 2 Ω; R = 48 Ω; I = ?
I = Ε ⁄ (R + r) = 20 ⁄ (48 + 2) A = 0.4 A

Te power of a source (Ps) is the rate at which the source is converting non-electrical energy
to electrical energy. In other words, it is the rate of doing work by the source in transporting
charges from one of the terminals to the other; that is Ps = Ws ⁄ t. and since Ws = Εq,
Ps = Ε(q ⁄ t). But q ⁄ t = I. Terefore the power of a source is equal to the product of its
emf and the current across it.
Ps = ΕI
Te power delivered to the external resistance (PR) is less than the power of the source
because some of the power is dissipated in its own internal resistance. Power dissipated in
its internal resistance is equal to I 2r. Te power delivered to the external resistance is also
equal to the power dissipated in the external resistance (I 2R).
PR = ΕI - I 2r = I 2R

An equivalent resistance (Req) of a combination of resistors is defined to be the single resistor
that can replace the combination without changing the current and potential difference
across the combination. It is equal to the ratio between the total potential difference across
the combination (ΔV) and the total current (I) across the combination.
Req = ΔV ⁄ I

Series combination of resistors is combination where the resistors are connected in a single
line. Te following diagram shows series combination of three resistors.
Figure 4.2
Let’s consider resistors R1, R2, R3, … connected in series. Since they are connected in a
single line, the currents through all of them are the same and are equal to the total current
across the combination.

ΔV1, ΔV2, ΔV3, … are potential differences across resistors R1, R2, R3, … respectively. ΔV is
the total potential difference across the combination. Te total current across the combination
is equal to the sum of the currents across the individual resistors.

across the combination. Replacing each current in this equation by the corresponding
ratio between the corresponding potential difference and resistance and noting that all the
potential differences are equal, the following expression for the equivalent resistance of
resistors combined in parallel can be obtained.
1 ⁄ Req = 1 ⁄ Req + 1 ⁄ R2 + 1 ⁄ R3 + …
If there are two resistors only, this expression can be simplified by direct addition:
1 ⁄ Req = (R1 + R2) ⁄ (R1 R2). And an expression for the equivalent resistance of two resistors
in parallel is obtained by inverting this equation.
Req = R1 R2 ⁄ (R1 + R2)

When a combination involves a number of series and parallel combinations, the problem
can be dealt with by replacing each parallel or series combination by its equivalent resistance
and repeating the process as necessary.
Example Calculate the equivalent resistance of a 10 Ω, a 20 Ω, a 30 Ω and a 40 Ω resistors
a) When they are connected in series.
Solution: R1 = 10 Ω; R2 = 20 Ω; 3 = 30 Ω; R4 = 40 Ω; Req = ?
Req = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 = (10 + 20 + 30 + 40) Ω = 100 Ω

c) when the parallel combination of the 10, 20 and 30 Ω is connected in series with
the 40 Ω resistor.
Solution: First the equivalent resistance of the resistors in parallel (R1,2,3) should be obtained.

d) when a parallel combination of the 10 and 20 Ω resistors is connected in series
with a parallel combination of the 30 and 40 Ω resistors.
Solution: First the equivalent resistances of the parallel combinations (R1,2 and R3,4). Ten
these equivalent resistances should be combined in series.
Req = ?
R1,2 = R1 R2 ⁄ (R1 + R2) = 10 * 20 ⁄ (10 + 20) Ω = 6.7 Ω
R3,4 = R3 R4 ⁄ (R3 + R4) = 30 * 40 ⁄ (30 + 40) Ω = 7.7 Ω
Req = R1,2 + R3,4 = (6.7 + 7.7) Ω = 14.4 Ω
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A parallel combination of of a 5 and 15 ohm resistors is connected in series with
a 20 ohm resistor. Ten the combination is connected to a potential difference of 30 V.
a) Calculate the equivalent resistance of the combination.
Solution: First the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination (R1,2) should be
obtained; and then this resistance should be combined in series with the other resistor.
R1 = 5 Ω; R2 = 15 Ω; R3 = 20 Ω; Req = ?
R1,2 = R1 R2 ⁄ (R1 + R2) = 5 * 15 ⁄ (5 + 15) Ω = 3.75 Ω
Req = R1,2 + R4 = (3.75 + 20) Ω = 23.75 Ω
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Calculate the current and potential difference across the 20 Ω resistor.
Solution: Since the 20 ohm resistor is in series with R1,2, the current across the 20 ohm
resistor should be equal to the total current.
ΔV = 30 V; I3 = ?; ΔV3 = ?
I3 = I1,2 = I = ΔV ⁄ Req = 30 ⁄ 23.75 A = 1.3 A

4.5                                                                                                    KIRCHOFF’S RULES
Kirchoff’s rules are rules used to solve complex circuits. Tere are two of them. Tey are
known as the junction rule and the loop rule.
Kirchoff’s junction rule states that the sum of all the currents in a junction is zero.
∑ I = I1 ± I2 ± I3 … = 0
A junction is a point in a circuit where two or more wires meet. Currents headed towards
the junction are taken to be positive whereas currents going away from the junction are
taken to be negative.
Kirchoff’s loop rule states that the sum of all potential differences in a loop is zero.
∑ ΔV = ΔV1 + ΔV2 + ΔV3 + … = 0
In going around a loop, to apply the loop rule a transversing direction (clockwise or counter
clockwise) should be chosen. Te potential difference across the terminals of a battery is taken
to be positive if the battery is transversed from its negative to its positive terminal and negative
if transversed from its positive terminal to its negative terminal. Te potential difference across
the terminals of a resistor is taken to be negative if the resistor is transversed in the direction
of the current and positive if transversed opposite to the direction of the current.
4.5.1                                                                                                  APPLYING KIRCHOFF’S RULES
In applying Kirchoff’s rules, the following procedures may be followed.
1. For each wire in the circuit, assign a variable to the current and choose a direction
for the current arbitrarily. If after solving the problem a current turns out to be
positive, the actual direction of the current is the same as the chosen direction;
and if the current turns out to be negative, the actual direction of the current is
opposite to the chosen direction.
2. Assign transversing direction to each simple loop in the circuit. A simple loop is
a non-intersecting loop or a loop that is not divided into more loops. Tis is the
direction to be followed while applying Kirchoff’s loop rule.

3. If there are n junctions in a circuit, apply the Kirchoff’s junction rule only to n -
1 of them, because the n th junction will not result in an independent equation.
Current variables should be treated as positives. Negatives should be introduced
outside the variable. For example if a current I is going away from a junction, in
applying the junction rule, it should appear as -I.
4. Apply the loop rule to all the simple loops of the circuit. A starting point should be
chosen for each simple loop and the loop should be transversed in the direction of
the chosen transversing direction to add all the potential differences in the simple
loop. Variables for unknown emfs should be treated as positives. Negatives should
be introduced outside the variable. For example if the unknown emf is represented
by Ε and the battery is transversed from its positive to its negative terminal, in
applying the loop rule, it should appear as -Ε.
5. Solve the resulting system of linear equations.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Consider the circuit shown below. Resistors A and C have resistances of 20 and
60 ohm respectively. Batteries B and D have emfs of 8 and 4 V respectively. Determine the
value and the direction of the current in the circuit.

does not have a junction and thus no need to apply the junction rule. Only the loop rule
need to be applied. Te potential differences across both resistors should be taken to be
positive because they are being transverse opposite to the direction of the current. Te
potential difference across the terminals of battery B should be taken to be positive because
the battery is being transversed from its negative to its positive terminal. Te potential
difference across the terminals of battery D should be taken to be negative because the
battery is being transversed from its positive to its negative terminal. Let the starting point
be the lower right corner of the circuit.
RA = 20 Ω; RC = 60 Ω; ΕB = 8 V; ΕD = 4 V; I = ?
∑ ΔV = ΔV1 + ΔV2 + ΔV3 + … = 0
IRC - ΕD + IRA + ΕB = 0
I(60 Ω) - 4 V + I(20 Ω) + 8 V = 0

I(80 Ω) = -4 V
I = -4 ⁄ 80 A = -0.05 A
Since the current turned out to be negative the actual direction should be opposite to the
assigned direction (clockwise). Te actual direction of the current is counter clockwise.

Example: Consider the circuit shown below. Resistors A, C and D have resistances of 10, 20
and 30 ohm respectively. Batteries B, E and F have emfs of 6, 12 and 20 V. Calculate all the

Te junction rule should be applied to one of the junctions say the upper junction.
I1 should be taken to be positive because it is directed towards the junction. I2 and I3 should
be multiplied by -1 because they are directed away from the junction.
I1 - I2 - I3 = 0
I3 = I1 - I2 … . . (1)
In the equations to follow I3 will be replaced by I1 - I2 to get two equations in two variables.
Next the loop rule should be applied to one of the simple loops, say the simple loop on
the left (loop ABCEA). Te potential differences across resistors A and C should be taken
to be positive because the resistors are being transversed opposite to the directions of the
assigned currents. Te potential difference across the terminals of battery B should be taken
to be positive because it is being transversed from its negative to its positive terminal. Te
potential difference across the terminals of battery E should be taken to be negative because
it is being transversed from its positive to its negative terminal. Starting at the left lower
corner of the circuit
ΕB + I2 RC - ΕE + I1 RA = 0
6 V + I2 (20 Ω) - 12 V + I1 (10 Ω) = 0
10I1 + 20I2 = 6 A
I2 = (6 A - 10I1) ⁄ 20 = 0.3 A - 0.5I1 … (2)
Next the loop rule should be applied to the second simple loop (loop CDFC). Te potential
difference across resistor D is taken to be negative because it is being transversed in the
direction of the current. Te potential difference across resistor C is taken to be positive
because it is being transversed opposite to the direction of the current. Te potential difference
between the terminals of battery F is taken to be negative because it is being transversed
from its positive to its negative terminal. Starting from the lower right corner
I2 RC - 20 V - I3 RD = 0
I2 (20 Ω) - 20 V - I3 (30 Ω) = 0
20I2 - 30I3 = 20 A

Substituting for I3 from equation (1) (I3 = I1 - I2)
20I2 - 30(I1 - I2) = 20 A
-30I1 + 50I2 = 20 A
Substituting for I2 from equation (2) (I2 = 0.3 A - 0.5I1)
-30I1 + 50(0.3 A - 0.5I1) = 20 A
-55I1 = 5 A
I1 = -5 ⁄ 55 A = -0.09 A
Te negative sign indicates that the direction of I1 is opposite to the chosen direction.
Current I2 can be obtained from equation (2).
I2 = 0.3 A - 0.5I1 = (0.3 - 0.5 * -0.09) A = 0.345 A

Since the current is positive, the direction of I2 is the same as the assigned direction. I3 can
be obtained from equation (1).
I3 = I1 - I2 = (-0.09 - 0.345) A = -0.435 A
Te direction of I3 is opposite to the assigned direction because it is negative.

Example: Consider Figure 4 again. Resistors A and C have resistances of 5 and 15 ohm.
Battery B has an emf of 6 V. Tere is a current of 2 A in the circuit in the indicated
direction (clockwise). Calculate the emf of battery D.
Solution: Te unknown emf can be solved by applying the loop rule. Te polarity of the
unknown emf (the order of its negative and positive terminals) is also unknown. Te
unknown emf can be assigned an arbitrary polarity. If, after solving the problem, the emf
turns out to be positive, then the actual polarity is the same as the chosen polarity; and
if it turns out to be negative, the actual polarity is opposite to the chosen polarity. In the
diagram, an arbitrary polarity has already been assigned to the unknown emf. Te potential
differences across both resistors are positive because they are being transversed opposite to the
direction of the current. Te potential difference across battery B should be positive because
it is being transversed from its negative to its positive terminal. Te potential difference
across battery D should be negative because it is being transversed from its positive to its
negative terminal.
I = 2 A; RA = 5 Ω; RC = 15 Ω; ΕB = 6 V; ΕD = ?
Starting at the lower left corner
ΕB + IRC - ΕD + IRA = 0
6 V + 2 * 15 V - ΕD + 2 * 5 V = 0
ΕD = 46 V
Since ΕD turned out to be positive, its actual polarity is the same as the chosen polarity.

Your goals for this chapter are to learn about magnetic fields, magnetic forces, magnetic
torque, and Ampere’s law.
Experiment shows that current carrying objects exert force on each other. Te force that
exists between objects due to the currents they carry is called magnetic force. For example two
current carrying wires will exert magnetic forces on each other. Te origin of the magnetic
force between permanent magnets is the current due to the motion of electrons around the
nucleus of the atom. For most of the elements, the currents due to their electrons cancel
each other and their atoms are not magnetic. But for some elements such as iron, cobalt
and nickel, the currents due to their electrons do not cancel each other and their atoms
are magnetic. A sample of a magnetic element such as iron is normally not magnetic even
though the atoms of the sample are magnetic. Tis is because the atomic magnets are
distributed randomly and they cancel each other. But if a sample of a magnetic substance
is placed near a permanent magnet or a current carrying object, the atomic magnets will
be aligned in the same direction and the sample acquires a net magnetic property (that is,
it becomes a permanent magnet).
5.1                                                                                               MAGNETIC FIELD
Magnetic field is a physical quantity used to represent magnetic force. A magnetic substance
is assumed to set up magnetic field throughout space and this field exerts magnetic force on
a magnetic substance placed at any point in space. Magnetic field is defined to be magnetic
force on a current carrying wire per a unit current and per a unit length when the current
is perpendicular to the magnetic field. Its unit of measurement is N ⁄ A ⁄ m which is defined
to be the Tesla, abbreviated as T.
5.1.1                                                                                             MAGNETIC FIELD LINES
Magnetic field lines are lines used to represent magnetic field. Te number of lines that cross
a unit perpendicular area is drawn in such a way that it is proportional to the magnitude of
the magnetic field. Te line of action of the magnetic field at a given point is represented
by the line of action of the line tangent to the curve at the given point. Arrows are put on
the field lines to distinguish between the two possible directions of the tangent line.

For permanent magnets of certain shapes, there are two locations where the strength of the
magnetic field is the strongest. Tese locations are called the Magnetic poles of the magnet.
Tese two poles are identified as north and south poles. If a magnet is free to rotate across
a pivot one of its poles will point towards the North Pole. Te pole that points towards the
North Pole is identified as the North Pole and the other pole as the South Pole. Experiment
shows that similar poles repel and opposite poles attract. Te reason a magnet aligns itself
along the north South Pole axis (approximately) is because earth has its own magnet aligned
along the north-south pole axis. Since the north pole of a magnet points towards the North
Pole, the pole of earths magnet located at the North Pole must be a south pole; and the
one located at the south pole of earth also must be its north pole.
Magnetic field lines form complete loops. Tey don’t originate somewhere and sink somewhere
as electric field lines do. Magnetic field lines come out of the North Pole and come into
the south pole of a magnet.

5.2   MAGNETIC FORCE ON A CHARGE MOVING IN A MAGNETIC FIELD
A moving charge sets up its own magnetic field because motion of a charge is essentially
a current. Tus a moving charge placed in a magnetic field due to other sources is acted
upon by a magnetic force. Te magnitude of the magnetic force (FB) acting on a charge
moving in a magnetic field is proportional to the speed of the charge (v), the strength of
the field (B), the charge (q) and the sine of the angle (θ) between the field and the velocity
of the charge.
FB = |q|vB sin (θ)
Te direction of the magnetic force is perpendicular to the plane determined by the
velocity and magnetic field vectors; Tat is, the force is directed either perpendicularly out
from this plane or perpendicularly into this plane. Te directions perpendicularly out and
perpendicularly in are symbolically represented by a dot (.) and a cross (x) respectively. To
distinguish between the perpendicularly in and out, either the screw rule or the right hand
rule can be used.
5.2.1                                                                                            THE SCREW RULE
To use the screw rule, first join the velocity vector and the field vector tail to tail.
Ten place a screw at their tails in a direction perpendicular to both vectors. Ten rotate

Example: A 4 mC charge is going north-east in a uniform magnetic field of strength 2 T
directed towards east with a speed of 600 m ⁄ s. Determine the magnitude and direction
of the magnetic force acting on the charge.
Solution: Let’s use the screw rule to determine the direction. If a screw is placed in direction
perpendicular to both the field and the velocity and is turned from the velocity vector
(north-east) towards the field vector (east), the screw goes in. Since the charge is positive,
the direction of the magnetic force must be perpendicularly in (x).
q = 4 mC = 4e-3 C; v = 600 m ⁄ s; B = 2 T; θ = 45°; FB = ?
FB = |q|vB sin (θ) = 4e-3 * 600 * 2 * sin (45°) N = 3.4 N
FB = 3.4 N perpendicularly in (x).
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A -6 n C is moving west with a speed of 3e6 m ⁄ s in a region where the magnetic
field is directed perpendicularly into the plane of the paper (x). Te strength of the magnetic
field is 6 mT. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field acting on the charge.
Solution: Let’s use the right hand rule to determine the direction. If the index finger and the
middle finger of the right hand are arranged in such a way that the index finger is directed
in the direction of the velocity (west) and the middle finger is directed in the direction of
the field (perpendicularly in), the thumb points south (down the paper) when arranged to
be perpendicular to both fingers. Since the charge is negative, the direction of the magnetic
force is opposite to that of the thumb. Tus the direction of the magnetic force is north
(towards the top of the paper). Te angle between the velocity and the field is 90° because
they are perpendicular to each other.
q = -6 nC = -6e-9 C; v = 3e6 m ⁄ s; B = 6 mT = 6e-3 T; θ = 90°; FB = ?
FB = |q|vB sin (θ) = 6e-9 * 3e6 * 6e-3 * sin (90°) N = 1.08e-4 N
FB = 1.08e-4 N south

5.2.3  MAGNETIC FORCE ON A CURRENT CARRYING STRAIGHT WIRE PLACED IN
A MAGNETIC FIELD
Te magnitude of the magnetic force (FB) on a current carrying straight wire placed in a
magnetic field is directly proportional to the current (I), length (l) of the wire, strength of
the field (B) and the sine of the angle (θ) between the wire (whose direction is taken to be
the direction of the current) and the magnetic field.
FB = IlB sin (θ)
Te direction of the force is perpendicular to the plane determined by the wire and the
field. Whether it is perpendicularly out or perpendicularly in can be determined by using
the screw rule or the right hand rule. In using the screw rule, the screw should be placed
perpendicularly at the intersection of the wire and field and rotated from the wire towards
the field. Te direction of movement of the screw gives the direction of the magnetic force
acting on the wire. In using the right hand rule, the index finger and the middle finger
should be aligned in the direction of the wire and the field respectively. When aligned in
a direction perpendicular to both fingers, the thumb gives the direction of the magnetic
force acting on the wire.

Example: A wire of length 1.5 m carrying a current of 3 A to the right is placed in a uniform
magnetic field of strength 5 T directed to the left. Determine the magnitude and direction
of the magnetic force acting on the wire.
Solution: Te angle between the wire and the field is 180° because the current and the field
have opposite directions.
I = 3 A; l 1.5 m; B = 5 T; θ = 180°; FB = ?
FB = IlB sin (θ) = 3 * 1.5 * 5 * sin (180°) N = 0
No need to specify direction since the force is zero.
FB = 0
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A wire of length 2 m carrying a current of 10 A towards south (towards the bottom
of the paper) is placed in a 7 T magnetic field whose direction is perpendicularly out of the
paper (.). Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic force acting on the wire.
Solution: Let’s use the screw rule to determine the direction. Te plane determined by the
wire (south) and the field (perpendicularly out) is the plane perpendicular to the plane of
this paper. When the screw is put perpendicular to this plane from the right side of the
plane and rotated from the wire (south) towards the field, it goes in towards west. Terefore
the direction of the magnetic force acting on the wire is west. Te angle between the wire
and the field is 90°.
I = 10 A; l = 2 m; B = 7 T; θ = 90°; FB = ?
FB = IlB sin (θ) = 10 * 2 * 7 N = 140 N
FB = 140 N west

5.3   MAGNETIC TORQUE ON A CURRENT CARRYING LOOP PLACED
IN A MAGNETIC FIELD
Consider a current carrying rectangular loop placed in a magnetic field directed towards
the right. Te horizontal parts of the rectangular loop will not experience any force because
the angle between the current and the field is zero for one of them and 180° for the other.
But the vertical wires experience magnetic force, because the angle between the current and
the wire is 90° for both of them. Te magnetic forces on the two vertical wires are equal
in magnitude but opposite in direction because the directions of the currents are opposite.
Tis creates a rotational effect on the wire that is called magnetic torque. Torque is defined
to be the product of force and the perpendicular distance between point of rotation and
line of action of force. Te unit of measurement of magnetic torque is Nm. Te magnetic
torque (τB) acting on a current carrying loop placed in a magnetic field is proportional to
the current, area of the loop (A), strength of the magnetic field, and the sine of the angle
between the area of the loop and the field.
τB = IAB sin (θ)
Area is a vector quantity whose magnitude is the area of the loop and whose direction is
perpendicular to the plane of the loop. Te right hand rule can be used to distinguish between
perpendicularly in (x) and perpendicularly out (.). If the fingers are wrapped around the
loop in a counter clockwise direction and the thumb is pointing in a direction perpendicular
to the fingers, then the direction of area is the same as the direction of the thumb. Te
direction of area is usually perpendicularly out or the direction pointing towards you.
Te direction of magnetic torque is perpendicular to the plane determined by the area
vector and the field vector. To distinguish between perpendicularly in and perpendicularly
out, either the screw rule or the right hand rule can be used. If using the screw rule, place
the screw on the intersection of the area vector and the field vector and then rotate the
screw from the area vector towards the field vector. If the direction of the current is counter
clockwise, the direction of the magnetic torque is the same as the direction of movement of
the screw. If the direction of the current is clockwise, the direction of the torque is opposite
to the direction of movement of the screw.

If using the right hand rule, align the index finger and the middle finger along the
directions of the area vector and the field vector respectively. Align the thumb in a direction
perpendicular to both fingers. Te direction of the thumb is the same as the direction of
the torque if the direction of current is counter clockwise and opposite to the direction of
the magnetic force if the direction of the current is clockwise.
Te direction of rotation (that is either clockwise or counter clockwise) and the direction
of torque are related by the right hand rule. To use the right hand rule, wrap the fingers
around the direction of torque with thumb pointing in the direction of the torque. Te
direction of rotation is the same as the direction of the fingers.

Example: A circular loop of radius 0.2 m and carrying a current of 0.5 A in a counter
clockwise direction is placed in the plane of the paper. Tere is a magnetic field of strength
8 T directed towards the right.
a) Determine the magnitude and direction of the area of the loop.
Solution: Te direction of area can be obtained by wrapping the fingers around the loop
in a counter clockwise direction with thumb perpendicular to the fingers. Te direction of
thumb will be perpendicularly out. Terefore the direction of the area is perpendicularly out.
r = 0.2 m; A = ?
A = πr 2 = 3.14 * 0.2 2 m 2 = 0.13 m 2
A = 0.13 m 2 perpendicularly out (.)
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic torque acting on the wire.
Solution: Te direction of the magnetic torque is perpendicular to the plane determined by
the area vector (perpendicularly out) and the field vector (right). When a screw placed on
the intersection of these vectors perpendicularly and turned from the area vector towards
the field vector, the screw moves towards north. Since the direction of the current is
counter clockwise, the direction of the torque is the same as the direction of movement
of the screw which is north. Te angle between the area vector and the field is 90°.
I = 0.5 A; A = 0.13 m 2; B = 8 T; θ = 90°; τB = ?
τB = IAB sin (θ) = 0.5 * 0.13 * 8 * sin (90°) Nm = 0.52 Nm
τB = 0.52 Nm north
_______________________________________________________________________
c) Is the loop rotating clockwise or counter clockwise about an axis in the direction
of the torque?
Solution: Te direction of rotation is related with the direction of the magnetic torque
by the right hand rule. When thumb points north, the fingers are wrapped in a counter
clockwise direction. Terefore the loop is rotating in a counter clockwise direction along
an axis in the direction of the torque.

5.4                                                                                                     MASS SPECTROMETER
A mass spectrometer is a device that separates a mixture of charged particles according to
their masses. When a mixture of charged particles is propelled into a magnetic field, the
particles will follow circular trajectories because the magnetic force is perpendicular to the
trajectory. Particles with different masses will follow circular trajectories with different radii
resulting in the separation of the particles according their masses.
Suppose a particle of mass m and charge q is propelled into a magnetic field of strength B
perpendicularly. It will experience a magnetic force of magnitude |q|vB which is perpendicular
to its trajectory and the field. Since the force is perpendicular to the trajectory, the trajectory
will be circular. Te centripetal force for the circular trajectory is supplied by the magnetic force.
Terefore Fc = mv 2 ⁄ R = |q|vB, where R is the radius of the circular trajectory. Solving for R
R = mv ⁄ (|q|B)
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A proton (mass 1.67e-27 kg and charge 1.6e-19 C) is propelled into a magnetic
field of strength 2 T. If it moves in a circular trajectory of radius 0.003 m, calculate the
speed with which it was propelled into the field.
Solution: q = 1.6e-19 C; m = 1.67e-27 kg; B = 2 T; R = 0.003 m; v = ?
R = mv ⁄ (|q|B)
v = |q|BR ⁄ m = 1.6e-19 * 2 * 0.003 ⁄ (1.67e-27) m ⁄ s = 5.7e5 m ⁄ s

A galvanometer is a device used to measure very small currents and potential differences. Te
main components of a galvanometer are a permanent magnet and a coil. As current passes
through the coil, the coil is acted upon by a magnetic torque and the coil deflects. Te coil is
connected to a spring; and thus it stops at a certain deflection angle. Tis deflection angle is
proportional to the amount of current that passes through the coil. Terefore, the current can
be measured by measuring the deflection angle. If the deflection angle for a certain current is
known, the galvanometer can be calibrated to measure currents (or potential differences) over
a small range. Te maximum deflection of a galvanometer occurs for very small currents and
potential differences. It cannot be used to measure real life currents and potential differences.
But it can be modified to do so.

An ammeter is a device used to measure currents. An ammeter is connected in series with
the part of a circuit whose current is to be measured. A galvanometer can be converted into
an ammeter by connecting a small resistance shunt in parallel with the galvanometer. Te
shunt can be designed in such a way that most of the current in the circuit passes through
the shunt and only a small portion of the current passes through the galvanometer. Suppose
the maximum deflection of a galvanometer occurs when the current is IG and we want to
convert it to an ammeter whose maximum deflection occurs when the current is IA. Te
resistance (Rs) of the shunt should be designed in such a way that only current IG passes
through the galvanometer (of resistance RG) and the remaining current IA - IG passes through
the shunt. Since the galvanometer and the shunt are in parallel, their potential difference
are equal: IG RG = (IA - IG)RS. Tus, the resistance of the shunt that should be connected
in parallel with the galvanometer to convert it to the required ammeter is given as follows.
Rs = IG RG ⁄ (IA - IG)
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Te maximum deflection of a galvanometer of resistance 15 ohm occurs when
the current is 0.003 A. Calculate the resistance of the shunt that should be connected in
parallel with the galvanometer to convert it to an ammeter whose maximum deflection
occurs when the current is 6 A.
Solution: RG = 15 Ω; IG = 0.003 A; IA = 6 A; Rs = ?
Rs = IG RG ⁄ (IA - IG) = 0.003 * 15 ⁄ (6 - 0.003) Ω = 0.0075 Ω

A voltmeter is a device that is used to measure potential differences. A voltmeter is connected
in parallel with the part of a circuit whose potential difference is to be measured. A
galvanometer can be converted to a voltmeter by connecting a high resistance shunt in
series with the galvanometer. Te resistance of the shunt should be designed in such a way
that most of the potential difference in the circuit drops across the shunt and only a small
portion of the potential difference drops across the galvanometer. Suppose the maximum
deflection of the galvanometer occurs when the potential difference is VG = IG RG and we
want to convert it to a voltmeter whose maximum deflection is VV. Te resistance of the
shunt should be designed in such a way that only a potential difference VG drops across
the galvanometer and the remaining potential difference VV - VG drops across the shunt.
Since the galvanometer and the shunt are in series, they should have the same current:
VG ⁄ RG = (VV - VG) ⁄ Rs. Terefore, the resistance of the shunt that needs to be connected
in series with the galvanometer to convert it to the required voltmeter is given by
Rs = (VV - VG)RG ⁄ VG
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Te maximum deflection of a galvanometer of resistance of 5 ohm occurs when
the current is 0.002 A. Calculate the resistance of the shunt that needs to be connected in
series with the galvanometer to convert it to a voltmeter whose maximum reading is 5 V.
Solution: IG = 0.002 A (VG = IG RG); RG = 5 Ω; VV = 5 V; Rs = ?
VG = IG RG = 0.002 * 5 V = 0.01 V
Rs = (VV - VG)RG ⁄ VG = (5 - 0.01) * 5 ⁄ 0.01 Ω = 2495 Ω

Ampere’s law is a law that establishes a relationship between currents and the magnetic field
they produce. Ampere’s law states that the summation over a closed path of the product of
the tangential component of the magnetic field (B||) at a certain point and a small path
element (Δs) evaluated over a closed path is proportional to the total current (I) crossing
the closed path.

5.7.2  MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO AN INFINITELY LONG STRAIGHT CURRENT
CARRYING WIRE
From symmetry, it can be concluded that the magnitude of the magnetic field at all points
that are at the same perpendicular distance from the wire is the same. Tis is because each
point can be considered to lie on the perpendicular bisector of the wire since the wire is
infinitely long.

Experiment shows that a charge moving parallel to the wire is acted upon by a magnetic
force perpendicular to its trajectory directed towards or away from the wire perpendicularly.
From the screw rule, it follows that the direction of the magnetic field is tangent to a
circular path concentric with wire. Terefore the shape of the magnetic field lines must be
concentric circles centered at the wire.
Let’s apply Ampere’s law on a concentric circle of radius r. Te tangential component
of the field is equal to the magnitude of the field itself because the field is tangent to
a concentric circle. Also the magnitude of the field on a concentric circle is a constant.
Terefore ΣB|| Δs = BΣΔs = B(2πr) = μo I (ΣΔs is equal to the circumference of the concentric
circle.). Tis implies that
B = μo I ⁄ (2πr)
B is the magnitude of the magnetic field due to an infinitely long wire carrying a current
I at a point a perpendicular distance r from the wire.
Te direction of the field at a given point is tangent to a concentric circle passing through the
point. To distinguish between the two possible directions of the tangent line, the right hand
rule can be used. If the thumb is aligned along the direction of the current and the fingers
are wrapped around the wire, then the direction of the fingers gives the direction of the field.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A long straight wire is carrying a current of 2 A to the right
a) Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field due to the current
in the wire at a point 2 m above the wire (on the plane of the paper).
Solution: Te direction of the field is tangent to a concentric circle passing through the
point. Te plane of the concentric circle is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. Tat
means, the direction of the field is either perpendicularly in or perpendicularly out. To
distinguish between these two directions, the right hand rule can be used. When the
thumb is aligned to the right, the fingers are wrapped in a direction that comes out of
the paper. Te direction of the field must be perpendicularly out (.).
I = 2 A; r = 2 m; B = ?
B = μo I ⁄ (2πr) = 4πe-7 * 2 ⁄ (2π * 2) T = 2e-7 T
B = 2e-7 T perpendicularly out (.)

b) Determine the magnitude and direction of the field due to the current in the wire
at a point 4 m below the wire (on the plane of the paper)
Solution: Te direction of the field is tangent to a concentric circle passing through the
point. Te plane of the concentric circle is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. Tat
means, the direction of the field is either perpendicularly in or perpendicularly out. To
distinguish between these two directions, the right hand rule can be used. When the

I = 2 A; r = 4 m; B = ?

B = 1e-7 T perpendicularly in (x)

Example: A long straight wire is carrying a current of 5 A perpendicularly into the plane
of the paper. Determine the magnitude and direction of the field at a point 2.5 m to the
right of the wire.
Solution: Te direction of the field is tangent to a concentric circle passing through the
point. Te plane of the concentric circle is the same as the plane of the paper. Terefore
the direction of the field is either north (towards the top of the paper) or south (towards
the bottom of the paper). Te right hand rule can be used to distinguish between these
two directions. If the thumb is directed perpendicularly in, then the fingers are wrapped in
a clockwise direction. Terefore the direction of the field must be south.
I = 5 A; r = 2.5 m; B = ?
B = μo I ⁄ (2πr) = 4πe-7 * 5 ⁄ (2π * 2.5) T = 4e-7 T

5.7.3  MAGNETIC FORCE PER UNIT LENGTH BETWEEN TWO CURRENT CARRYING
PARALLEL WIRES
Consider two parallel wires separated by a distance d and carrying currents I1 and I2 to
the right on the plane of the paper with wire 2 being below wire 1. Te magnetic field
due to wire 1 on the location of wire 2 will exert magnetic force on wire 2. Te magnetic
field due to wire 1 on the location of wire 2 has a magnitude of B12 = μo I1 ⁄ (2πd) and its
direction is perpendicularly in. Since the field due to wire 1 on the location of wire 2 and
the current of wire 1 are perpendicular to each other, the force per unit length exerted by
wire 1 on wire 2 has a magnitude of F ⁄ l = I2 B12 . Substituting for B12
F ⁄ l = μo I1 I2 ⁄ (2πd)
From the screw rule, the direction of the magnetic force exerted by wire 1 on wire 2 is
towards wire 1; that is wire 1 attracts wire 2. Te force exerted by wire 2 on wire 1 will
have the same magnitude but opposite direction. Generally, parallel wires carrying currents
in the same direction attract each other and parallel wires carrying currents in opposite
directions repel each other.

Example: Two long parallel and horizontal wires are separated by a distance of 0.5 m on

wire carries a current of 8 A to the left. Determine the magnitude and direction of the
force per unit length exerted by the lower wire on the upper wire.
Solution: Since the wires are carrying wires in opposite directions, they repel each other.
Terefore the direction of the force exerted by the lower wire on the upper wire must be north.
I1 = 5 A; I2 = 8 A; d = 0.5 m; F ⁄ l = ?
F ⁄ l = μo I1 I2 ⁄ (2πd) = 4πe-7 * 5 * 8 ⁄ (2π * 0.5) N ⁄ m = 1.6e-5 N ⁄ m

A solenoid is a coil of a conducting wire. From symmetry considerations, it can be concluded
that the magnetic field due to a current carrying solenoid is uniform (and parallel to the
axis of the solenoid) inside the solenoid and approximately zero just outside the solenoid.
An expression for the magnetic field due to a solenoid can be obtained by applying Ampere’s
law to a rectangular path with two of its sides parallel to the solenoid with one of them
inside the solenoid and the other outside the solenoid. Te sides that are perpendicular to the
coil do not contribute to the summation in Ampere’s law, because the field is perpendicular
to the path element. Te side parallel to the solenoid but outside the solenoid also doesn’t
contribute because the field is zero. Only the inside parallel side contributes. For this
side B|| = B because the field is parallel to the axis of the solenoid. If the solenoid has N
turns, carries a current I and has a length l, Ampere’s law gives ΣBΔs = BΣΔs = Bl = μoNI.
Tus, the magnetic field due to a solenoid is given as
B = μo (N ⁄ l)I
And if the number of turns per unit length N ⁄ l is represented by n
B = μonI
Te direction of the field along its axis is related with the direction of the current in the
solenoid by the right hand rule. If fingers are wrapped around the solenoid in the direction
of the current, thumb points in the direction of the field.

Example: A solenoid of length 0.05 m has 200 turns. It carries a current of 9 A. Te direction
of the current is clockwise as seen from the side of its right end.
a) Calculate the field inside the solenoid.
l = 0.05 m; N = 200; I = 9 m; B = ?
B = μo (N ⁄ l)I = 4πe-7 * (200 ⁄ 0.5) * 9 T = 4.5e-3 T
_______________________________________________________________________
a) Determine whether its north pole is its right end or its left end.
Solution: When the fingers are wrapped around the solenoid in a clockwise direction as
seen from the right end, the thumb points towards the left. Terefore the direction of
the field must be towards the left. And since magnetic field lines come out of the North
Pole, the North Pole is the left end.

Magnetic flux (Φ) is a physical quantity used as a measure of the amount of magnetic field
that crosses a loop. It is defined to be the product of the perpendicular component of the
magnetic field crossing the loop and the area of the loop: Φ = B⊥ A. If θ is the angle
between the area of the loop and the magnetic field, then B⊥ = B cos (θ), where B is the
magnitude of the field. Terefore
Φ = BA cos (θ)

Remember, area is a vector quantity whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the
loop. When fingers are wrapped around the loop in a counter clockwise direction, thumb
gives the direction of area. Tis is usually perpendicularly out. Te unit of measurement
for magnetic flux is Tm² which is sometimes referred as Weber (Wb).
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Consider a circular loop of radius 0.04 m on the plane of the paper.
a) Determine the magnitude and direction of the area of the loop.
Solution: Te direction of the area can be obtained from the right hand rule. When
fingers are wrapped around the loop in a counter clockwise direction, thumb points
perpendicularly out. Tus the direction of the area is perpendicularly out from the plane
of the paper (.).
r = 0.04; A = ?
A = πr 2 = 3.14 * 0.04 2 m² = 0.005 m²
A = 0.005 m² perpendicularly out (.)
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Calculate the magnetic flux crossing the loop, when the loop is in a 5 T field
directed to the right.
Solution: Since the field is parallel to the plane of the loop and the direction of area is
perpendicularly out, the angle between area and field is 90°.
A = 0.005 m²; B = 5 T; θ = 90°; Φ = ?
Φ = BA cos (θ) = 5 * 0.005 * cos (90°) Tm² = 0

c) Calculate the magnetic flux crossing the loop when it is in a 2 T field that penetrates
the loop perpendicularly out.
Solution: Since both the area and the field are perpendicularly out, the angle between
area and field is zero.
A = 0.005 m²; B = 2 T; θ = 0;Φ = ?
Φ = BA cos (θ) = 2 * 0.005 * cos (0) Tm² = 0.01 Tm²
_______________________________________________________________________
d) Calculate the magnetic flux crossing the loop when a 0.4 T field penetrates the
loop perpendicularly in.
Solution: Since the area is perpendicularly out and the field is perpendicularly in, the angle
between the area and the field is 180°.
A = 0.005 m²; B = 0.5 T; θ = 180°; Φ = ?
Φ = BA cos (θ) = 0.5 * 0.005 * cos (180°) Tm² = -0.0025 Tm²
_______________________________________________________________________
Faraday’s law: states that whenever there is a change in the magnetic flux crossing a loop,
an emf (voltage) will be induced in the loop which is equal to the negative rate of change
of flux with time.
Εind = -ΔΦ ⁄ Δt = - (Φf - Φi) ⁄ Δt
Εind stands for the induced emf when the flux changes from Φi to Φf in a time interval Δt.
Te induced emf will result in induced current in the loop. Te direction of the current
is counter clockwise if the induced emf is positive and clockwise if the induced emf is
negative. Induced emf is positive when the flux decreases and negative when the flux increases
(Remember increase of a negative is a decrease). Tus the direction of induced current is
counter clockwise when flux decreases and is clockwise when flux increases.
Since magnetic flux depends on the strength of the field, the area of the loop and the angle
between area and field, induced emf can be produced by changing, the field strength, the
area of the loop or the angle between the area and the field.

Example: A rectangular loop of sides 0.02 m and 0.04 m is placed in a region where there is
a 6 mT field penetrating the loop perpendicularly in. Te strength of the field is increased
to 9 T in 0.2 seconds.
a) Calculate the average induced emf in the loop.
Solution: Te direction of the area is perpendicularly out. Terefore the angle between
the area and the field is 180° because the direction of the field is perpendicularly in. Te
area and the angle remain the same. Only the field strength changes.
w = 0.02 m; l = 0.04 m (Ai = Af = wl); Bi = 6 T; Bf = 9 T; θi = θf = 180°; Δt = 0.2 s; Εind = ?
Ai = Af = wl = 0.02 * 0.04 m² = 0.0008 m²
Φi = Bi Ai cos (θi) = 6 * 0.0008 * cos (180°) Tm² = -0.0048 Tm²
Φf = Bf Af cos (θf) = 9 * 0.0008 * cos (180°) Tm² = -0.0072 Tm²
Εind = -ΔΦ ⁄ Δt = - (Φf - Φi) ⁄ Δt = - (-0.0072 - -0.0048) ⁄ 0.2 V = 0.012 V

b) If the loop has a resistance of 10 ohm, calculate the induced current in the loop.
Is the current flowing clockwise or counter clockwise?
Solution: Since the induced emf is positive, the current is flowing counter clockwise.
R = 10 Ω; Iind = ?
Iind                                                                                                    = Εind ⁄ R = 0.012 ⁄ 10 A; 0.0012 A

Example: A square loop of side 2 m is placed in a region where there is a 5 T field whose
direction is perpendicularly out of the plane of the loop. Its shape is changed to a circle in 0.5 s.
a) Calculate the average induced emf in the loop.
Solution: Te angle between the area and the field is zero because the direction for both
of them is perpendicularly out. Te field strength and the angle remain the same. Only
the area is changing. As the shape changes, the perimeter (length of the wire) remains
the same. If the side of the square is w and the radius of the circle is r, then 4w = 2πr;
and r = 2w ⁄ π.
w = 2 m; Bi = Bf = 5 T; θi = θf = 0; Δt = 0.5; Εind = ?
Ai = w 2 = 2 * 2 m² = 4 m²
Af = πr 2 = π(2w ⁄ π) 2 = 4w 2 ⁄ π = 4 * 2 2 ⁄ 3.14 m² = 5.1 m²
Φi = Bi Ai cos (θi) = 5 * 4 * cos (0) Tm² = 20 Tm²
Φf = Bf Af cos (θf) = 5 * 5.1 * cos (0) Tm² = 25.5 Tm²
Εind = - (Φf - Φi) ⁄ Δt = - (25.5 - 20) ⁄ 0.5 V = -11 V
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Is the induced current flowing clockwise or counter clockwise?
Solution: It is flowing clockwise because the induced emf is negative.

Example: A square loop of side 0.2 m is placed in a 4 T field that is parallel to the plane of
the loop and directed to the right. Te loop is rotated about its right side by 90° in 0.4 s so
that the plane of the loop is perpendicular to the field. Calculate the average induced emf.
Solution: Initially the direction of the area is perpendicularly out. Tus, the initial angle is
90° because the field is parallel to the plane of the loop. As the loop is rotated, the direction
of the area becomes parallel to the plane of the loop directed towards the right (as seen
from the right). Terefore the final angle is zero because the field is also directed to the
right. Te magnitude of the area and the field strength remain the same.
w = 0.2 m (Ai = Af = w 2); Bi = Bf = 4 T; θi = 90°; θf = 0; Δt = 0.4 s; Εind = ?
Ai = Af = w 2 = 0.2 2 m² = 0.04 m²
Φi = Bi Ai cos (θi) = 4 * 0.04 * cos (&90°) Tm² = 0 Tm²
Φf = Bf Af cos (θf) = 4 * 0.04 * cos (0) Tm² = 0.16 Tm²
Εind = - (Φf - Φi) ⁄ Δt = - (0.16 - 0) ⁄ 0.4 V = -0.4 V
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A loop of radius 0.05 m is placed around a solenoid of radius 0.04 m in such a
way that it is concentric with the axis of the solenoid. Te solenoid has 300 turns, is 0.06
m long and carries a current of 4 A in a clockwise direction as seen from the right (its axis
is horizontal). Te current is turned off in 0.004 seconds.
a) Calculate the average induced voltage in the loop enclosing the solenoid.
Solution: Te magnetic field crossing the loop is that due to the solenoid. Te field due
to a solenoid is approximately zero outside the solenoid. Tus it is only the part of the
loop that intersects the solenoid that is being crossed by a magnetic field. Tis means, in
calculating the flux of the loop, the cross-sectional area of the solenoid and not the area
of the loop should be used. Te field inside a solenoid is given as B = μo (N ⁄ l)I. Te
direction of the area of the loop as seen from the right is to the right. From the right
hand rule, the direction of the field inside the solenoid is to the left. Terefore the angle
between the area and the field is 180°

Consider a conducting rod of length l sliding with a speed v in a U-shaped conductor
(whose width is l). Te rod and the closed end of the U-shaped conductor form a complete
loop. As the rod slides, the area of this loop changes. If there is a magnetic field crossing
the loop, the magnetic flux will change continuously as the area of the loop changes
continuously. According to Faraday’s law, this change in flux will result in an induced emf
in the loop. Tis kind of induced emf produced by the motion of a rod in a U-shaped
conductor placed in a magnetic field is called motional emf.
Suppose the U-shaped conductor is placed in a magnetic field of strength B that
penetrates its plane perpendicularly and the rod changes its location from xi to xf in a time
interval Δt. Te area of the loop changes from lxi to lxf. Tus the absolute value of its
motional emf (Εm) is given by |Εm | = Bl(xf -xi) ⁄ Δt. But (xf -xi) ⁄ Δt = v.
|Εm| = Blv
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A conducting rod of length                                                             0.25 m is sliding in a U-shaped conductor
(of width 0.25 m) with a speed of 5 m ⁄ s. Te U-shaped conductor is placed in a 0.06 T
field that penetrates its plane perpendicularly in.
a) Calculate the absolute value of the motional emf.
Solution: B = 0.06 T; l = 0.25 m; v = 5 m ⁄ s; |Εm | = ?
|Εm| = Blv = 0.06 * 0.25 * 5 V = 0.075 V

b) If the rod is sliding towards the open end, determine whether the induced current
is flowing clockwise or counter clockwise.
Solution: Since the direction of the field is perpendicularly in, the flux is negative
(because area is perpendicularly out). As the rod slides towards the open end, the flux
becomes more negative or decreases. When flux decreases, induced voltage is positive.
When induced voltage is positive, induced current flows in a counter clockwise direction.

6.4                                                                                                LENZ’S RULE
Lenz’s rule states that the direction of the induced current is in such a way as to oppose
the cause. If the cause of the induced current is an increase (decrease) of magnetic flux, the
direction of the induced current will be in such a way as to decrease (increase) the magnetic
flux. For example if an increase in magnetic field is the cause for the increase in magnetic
flux, then the direction of the induced current should be in such a way that its induced
field opposes the external field so that the magnetic flux decreases.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A U-shaped conductor with its open end to the right is placed in a magnetic field
that penetrates its plane perpendicularly out. A rod is sliding on the U-shaped conductor to the
right by means of an external force. Te change in area of the loop formed by the rod and the
closed end of the U-shaped conductor will result in induced emf and hence induced current.
a) What is the cause for the change in flux?
Solution: Te cause for the change in flux is the external force pulling the rod to the right
causing change in area.

b) Tere will be an induced current in the rod as the rod is moving. A current carrying
rod placed in a magnetic field is acted upon by a magnetic force. What should the
direction of this force be?
Solution: According to Lenz’s rule, the direction of the induced current should be in such
a way as to oppose the cause. Te cause is the external force to the right. Terefore the
direction of the induced current must be in such a way that the direction of the magnetic
force is to the left so that it opposes the external force.
_______________________________________________________________________
c) Is the induced current flowing down or up the rod?
Solution: Since the magnetic force is to the left and the field is perpendicularly out, from
the screw rule or the right hand rule, the induced current must be flowing down the rod
(as a screw is turned from the direction of the induced current (down the rod) towards
the field (perpendicularly out), it goes to the left).
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A loop is pulled away to the right from the north pole of a permanent magnet.
a) What is the cause for the change in magnetic flux crossing the loop?
Solution: As the loop is pulled away, the strength of the magnetic field crossing it decreases
because it is getting further and further from the magnet. Tus, the cause for the change
of flux is the decrease in magnetic field.
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Te change in the flux crossing the loop will produce induced current in the loop
and this induced current will produce its own induced field. What should the
direction of this induced field be?
Solution: According to Lenz’s rule, the direction of the induced current is in such a way
as to oppose the cause. Since the cause is decrease in magnetic field, the direction of the
induced current must be in such a way as to increase the field. To increase the field, the
induced field should be parallel to the field due to the permanent magnet. Te field due
to the permanent magnet is to the right since magnetic field lines come out of the North
Pole. Terefore the direction of the induced field must be to the right.

c) As seen from the right of the loop, is the induced current flowing clockwise or
counter clockwise.
Solution: From the right hand rule for solenoids, when thumb points to the right, fingers
are wrapped in a counter clockwise direction when seen from the right. Terefore the
induced current is flowing in a counter clockwise direction as seen from the right.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A loop is pushed towards the north pole of a magnet. Te North Pole is located
on the right end of the magnet.
a) What is the cause for the change of flux and hence induced current in the loop?
Solution: As the loop is pushed towards the magnet, the strength of the magnetic field
crossing the loop gets stronger and stronger because the loop is getting nearer and nearer.
Terefore the cause for the induced current is an increase in the strength of the field.
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Te induced current in the loop will produce its own induced magnetic field. What
should the direction of the induced field be?
Solution: Since the cause is an increase in magnetic field, according to Lenz’s rule, the
direction of the induced current must be in such a way as to decrease the field. To decrease
the field, the induced field should oppose the field due to the permanent magnet. Te
direction of the field due to the permanent magnet is to the right (magnetic field lines come
out of the North Pole). Terefore the direction of the induced field must be to the left.
_______________________________________________________________________
c) As seen from the right, is the induced current in the loop flowing clockwise or
counter clockwise.
Solution: Using the right hand rule for solenoids, when thumb points left fingers are
wrapped in a clockwise direction as seen from the right. Te induced current is flowing
in a clockwise direction as seen from the right.

Example: A loop is put around a solenoid. Te solenoid (whose axis is horizontal) carries a
current in a clockwise direction as seen from the right. Te current is turned off suddenly. As a
result there will be a temporary flow of induced current in the loop surrounding the solenoid.
a) What is the cause for the induced current?
Solution: As the current is turned off, the field due to the solenoid suddenly drops to
zero. Terefore the cause for the induced current is the decrease of the magnetic field
crossing the loop.

b) What should be the direction of the induced field due to the induced current in
the solenoid?
Solution: Since the cause is decrease of magnetic field, the direction of the induced current
must be in such a way as to increase the field. To increase the field, the induced field
should have the same direction as the field due to the solenoid. From the right hand
rule, the field due to the solenoid is to the left (When fingers are wrapped in a clockwise
direction as seen from the right, thumb points to the left). Terefore, the direction of the
induced field should be to the left.
_______________________________________________________________________
c) As seen from the right, is the induced current in the loop flowing clockwise or
counter clockwise.
Solution: Applying the right hand rule, when thumb points to the left, fingers are wrapped

seen from the right.

A generator is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. Its basic
components include a permanent magnet and a coil of conducting wire. As the coil rotates
in the magnetic field due to the permanent magnet, the angle between the area of the
coil and the field changes giving rise to change in magnetic flux which in turn produces
induced voltage.
Let’s consider a coil of cross-sectional area A and number of turns N rotating in a magnetic
field of strength B with an angular speed of ω. Assuming the area and the field are parallel
at t = 0, the angle between the area and field at an arbitrary time t is given by θ = ωt. Te
following expression gives the flux crossing the coil at an arbitrary time t (Te flux crossing
the coil is equal to N times the flux crossing one turn).
Φ = NBA cos (ωt)

Te induced voltage is equal to the negative rate of change of the flux with time (In the
language of calculus, the induced voltage is equal to the negative derivative of flux with time:
Εind = -dΦ ⁄ dt). Using calculus, the following expression for the induced voltage of a generator
at an arbitrary time can be obtained.
Εind = NBAω sin (ωt)
Te maximum value of the voltage (amplitude) is equal to Εmax = NBAω. Te time taken
for one complete oscillation (period) is equal to T = 2π ⁄ ω. Te number of cycles executed
per second is equal to f = ω ⁄ (2π)
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Te coil of a generator has 400 turns and a cross sectional area of 4e-3 m². It is
rotating in a field of strength 3 T with an angular speed of 5 rad ⁄ s.
a) Calculate the maximum value of the induced voltage.
Solution: N = 400; B = 3 T; A = 4e-3 m²; ω = 5 rad ⁄ s; Εmax = ?
Εmax = NBAω = 400 * 3 * 4e-3 * 5 V = 24 V
_______________________________________________________________________
b) How long does it take to make one complete cycle?
Solution: T = ?
T = 2π ⁄ ω = 2 * 3.14 ⁄ 5 s = 1.3 s
_______________________________________________________________________
c) How many cycles does it execute per second?
Solution: f = ?
f                                                                                                   = 1 ⁄ T = 1 ⁄ 1.3 Hz = 0.77 Hz

An inductor is a coil (like a solenoid). Its circuit symbol is a coil. As current passes through
an inductor, magnetic field is produced inside the inductor. If the current flowing in the
inductor changes, the field inside the coil changes giving rise to the change of the magnetic
flux crossing the coil which in turn produces induced voltage. Tis kind of induced voltage
in a coil produced by its own current is called self-induced emf (Εself). Te self-induced emf
in a coil is proportional to the negative rate of change of its own current with time. Te
constant of proportionality between the induced voltage and the negative rate of change of
current is called the inductance (L) of the coil.
Εself                                                                                              = - L ΔI ⁄ Δt = - L(If - Ii) ⁄ Δt

Te unit of measurement for inductance is Vs ⁄ A which is defined to be the Henry,
abbreviated as H. Te inductance of an inductor depends only on the geometry of the coil.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Te current through a 5 mH inductor changed from 4 A to 2 A in 0.4 s. Calculate
the average self-induced emf in the inductor.
Solution: L = 5 mH = 5e-3 H; Ii = 4 A; If = 2 A; Δt = 0.4; Εself = ?
Εself                                                                                                 = - L ΔI ⁄ Δt = - L(If - Ii) ⁄ Δt = - 5e-3 * (2 - 4) ⁄ 0.4 V = 2.5e-2 V

Consider a solenoid of length l and cross-sectional radius R with N turns. If the solenoid
is carrying current I, then the field inside the solenoid is given as B = μo (N ⁄ l)I. Te field
and the cross-sectional area have the same direction (or possibly opposite) since the direction
of the field inside a solenoid is along the axis of the solenoid (that is θ = 0). Tus, the flux
crossing the solenoid is given as Φ = NBA = Nμo (N ⁄ l)IπR 2. If the current is changing with
time, then the self-induced emf is given by Εself = - μo (N 2 ⁄ l) πR 2 ΔI ⁄ Δt = - LΔI ⁄ Δt.
Solving for L from this equation yields the inductance of a solenoid as a function of its geometry.
L = μoπN 2R 2 ⁄ l

Your goals for this chapter are to learn about alternating current circuits involving a resistor,
an inductor and a capacitor.
An alternating current circuit                                                                      (ac) is a circuit where the voltage and the current

v = V sin (ωt + β). v is the voltage at a given instant of time and is called instantaneous
voltage. V is the maximum value of the voltage and is called the amplitude of the voltage.
ω is the number of radians executed per second and is called the angular frequency of the
voltage. It is related with frequency (f) as ω = 2πf and with period (T) as ω = 2π ⁄ T. β is
called the phase angle of the voltage. Its effect is to shift the graph of sin (ωt) either to the
right (if negative) or to the left (if positive).
Phase angle of signal 2 minus the phase angle of signal 1 is called the phase shift (θ) of
signal 2 with respect to signal 1. Te one with a bigger phase angle is said to be leading
the other and the one with a smaller phase angle is said to be lagging from the other.
If v1 = V1 sin (ωt + β1) and v2 = V2 sin (ωt + β2), then
θ = β2 - β1
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: An ac voltage varies with time according to the equation v = 120 V sin (300t + π ⁄ 2)
a) What is the maximum value of the voltage?
Solution: V = ?
V = 120 V

b) How long does it take to make one complete oscillation?
Solution: ω = 300 rad ⁄ s; T = ?
T = 2π ⁄ ω = 2 *3.14 ⁄ 300 s = 0.021 s

θ = β2 - β1 = -π ⁄ 2 - π = -3π ⁄ 2
v1 is leading because its phase angle is bigger.

7.1                                                                                              A RESISTOR CONNECTED TO AN AC SOURCE
Let’s consider a resistor of resistance R connected to an ac source whose voltage varies
with time according to the equation v = V sin (ωt). Ohm’s law applies to ac circuits
instantaneously. Terefore the equation v = iR holds where i stands for the instantaneous
current. Tis implies that
i                                                                                                = (V ⁄ R) sin (ωt) when v = V sin (ωt)
Tis shows that, in a resistor, the phase shift (θR) between the voltage and the current is
zero. In other words, the voltage and the current are in phase.
θR = 0
Where θR = βv - βi is the phase shift of voltage with respect to current for a resistor. Since
i                                                                                                = I sin (ωt) = (V ⁄ R)sin (ωt), Ohm’s law also applies to the amplitudes of the voltage
and the current.
V = IR
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A resistor of resistance 50 ohm is connected to an ac source whose potential
difference varies with time according to the equation v = 20 V sin (100t).
a) Calculate the amplitude of the current.
Solution: V = 20 V; R = 50; I = ?
I = V ⁄ R = 20 ⁄ 50 A = 0.4 A
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Give a formula for the instantaneous current as a function of time.
Solution: ω = 100 rad ⁄ s; i (t) = ?
i                                                                                                (t) = I sin (ωt) = 0.4 A sin (100t)

c) Calculate the instantaneous voltage and current after 10 s.
Solution: t = 10 s; i = ?; v = ?
i                                                                                                  = I sin (ωt) = 0.4 * sin (100 * 10) A = 0.33 A

7.2                                                                                                A CAPACITOR CONNECTED TO AN AC SOURCE
Let’s consider a capacitor of capacitance C connected to an ac source whose potential difference
varies with time according to the equation v = V sin (ωt). Te instantaneous charge q of the
capacitor is related with the instantaneous voltage by q = vC. Te instantaneous current is
equal to the rate of change of the charge or the derivative of charge with respect to time in
the language of calculus. Terefore, using calculus (because it can’t be done algebraically), i
= dq ⁄ dt = C dv ⁄ dt = C d{ V sin (ωt)} ⁄ dt} = CVω cos (ωt). But cos (ωt) = sin (ωt + π/2)
i                                                                                                  = CVW sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2) when v = V sin (ωt)
Tis implies that for a capacitor, the voltage lags from the current by π ⁄ 2 or 90°.
θC = βv - βi = -π ⁄ 2
Where θC is the phase shift of the voltage with respect to current for a capacitor.
Since i = I sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2) = CVω sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2),
I = CVω
Where I is the amplitude of the current. Te ratio between the amplitude of the voltage
across a capacitor and the amplitude of the current across a capacitor is defined to be the
capacitive reactance (XC) of the capacitor.
XC = V ⁄ I
Te unit of measurement for capacitive reactance is ohm. Replacing I by VCω, it follows
that the capacitive reactance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to the frequency of the
voltage (current).
XC = 1 ⁄ (ωC)

a) Calculate its capacitive reactance.
Solution: C = 20 μF = 2e-5 F; ω = 500 rad ⁄ s; XC = ?

c) Give a formula for the current as a function of time.

Let’s consider an inductor of inductance L connected to an ac source where the current in
the circuit varies with time according to the equation i = I sin (ωt). From Kirchoff’s loop
rule, the voltage of the source is the negative of the self-induced voltage (so that they add
up to zero): v = -Εself. But Εself = -L di ⁄ dt (using calculus). Hence v = L di ⁄ dt = L d{I sin
(ωt)} ⁄ dt = LωI cos (ωt). And cos (ωt) = sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2).
v = LωI sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2) when i = I sin (ωt)
Tis means, for an inductor, the voltage leads the current by π ⁄ 2 or 90°.
θL = π ⁄ 2
Where θL = βv - βi is the phase shift of the voltage with respect to the current.
Since v = V sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2) = LωI sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2),
V = LωI
Te ratio between the amplitude of the voltage across an inductor and the current across
the inductor is called the inductive reactance (XL) of the inductor.
XL = V ⁄ I
Te unit of measurement for inductive reactance is the ohm. Replacing V by LωI, it is
seen that the inductive reactance of an inductor is directly proportional to the frequency
of the signal.
XL = ωL

Te net instantaneous potential difference (v) is equal to the sum of the instantaneous
potential differences across the resistor (vR), the inductor (vL) and capacitor (vC).
v = vR + vL + vC
In a resistor, the voltage and the current are in phase; that is, their phase angles are equal.
Terefore, since i = I sin (ωt), the instantaneous potential difference across the resistor is given by
vR = VR sin (ωt)
Where VR =IR. In an inductor, the voltage leads the current by π ⁄ 2; that is, the phase
angle of the voltage is π ⁄ 2 more than the phase angle of the current. Since the current is
given as i = I sin (ωt), the instantaneous potential difference across the inductor is given by
vL = VL sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2)

Where VL = IXL. In a capacitor, the potential difference lags from the current by π ⁄ 2; that
is the phase angle of the voltage is π ⁄ 2 less than the phase angle of the current. Since the
current is given as i = I sin (ωt), the instantaneous voltage across the capacitor is given by
vC = VC sin (ωt - π ⁄ 2)
Where VC = IXC . Te net instantaneous voltage is the sum of the instantaneous voltages across
the resistor, inductor and capacitor: v = VR sin (ωt) + VL sin (ωt + π ⁄ 2) + VC sin (ωt - π ⁄ 2). But
sin                                                                                                      (ωt                            +  π   ⁄   2)   =  cos   (ωt)  and  sin   (ωt   -  π   ⁄   2)   =   -cos   (ωt).  Terefore,
v = VR sin (ωt) + (VL - VC) cos (ωt). Also, if the phase shift of the net voltage with respect
to the current is θ, then
v = V sin (ωt + θ)
Tis expression of v can be expressed in terms of cos (ωt) and sin (ωt) by expanding the
sine: v = V cos (θ) sin (ωt) + V sin (θ) cos (ωt). Te coefficients of cos (ωt) and sin (ωt) of
both expressions of v can be equated because cos (ωt) and sin (ωt) are independent functions.
VR = V cos (θ) … (1)
VL - VC = V sin (θ) … (2)
An expression for the phase shift of the voltage with respect to the current can be obtained
by dividing equation (2) by equation (1): sin (θ) ⁄ cos (ωt) = tan (θ) = (VL - VC) ⁄ VC =
(IXL - IXC) ⁄ (IR) = (XL - XC) ⁄ R. Tus θ is given as follows:
θ = arctan {(XL - XC) ⁄ R} = {[ ωL - 1 ⁄ (ωC)] ⁄ R}
An expression for the amplitude of the net voltage can be obtained by squaring
equations (1) and (2) and adding: VR 2 + (VL - VC) 2 = {V cos (θ)} 2 + {V sin (θ)} 2 = V 2.
Terefore, the amplitude of the net voltage is related with the amplitudes of the voltages
across the resistor, inductor and capacitor as follows:
V = √ {VR 2 + (VL - VC) 2}
Te total impedance (Z) of the series combination is defined to be the ratio between the
between the amplitude of the net voltage and the amplitude of the current in the circuit.

An expression for Z in terms of R, L, C can be obtained by expressing the voltages in terms
of the current: Z = V ⁄ I = √ {(IR) 2 + (IXL - IXC) 2} ⁄ I. Hence,
Z = √ {R 2 + (XL - XC) 2} = √ {R 2 + [ωL - 1 ⁄ (ωC)] 2}

Example: A 200 Ω resistor, a 20 H inductor and a 5 mF capacitor are connected in series
and then connected to an ac source whose potential difference varies with time according
to the equation v = 120 V sin (15t).
a) Calculate the impedance of the circuit.
Solution: R = 200 Ω; L = 20 H; C = 5 mF = 5e-3 F; ω = 15 rad ⁄ s; Z = ?
Z = √ {R 2 + [ωL - 1 ⁄ (ωC)] 2} = √ {200 2 + (15 * 20 - 1 ⁄ 15 ⁄ 5e-3) 2} Ω = 349.5 Ω

VL = IXL = IωL = 0.343 * 15 * 20 V = 102.9 V

d) Calculate the phase shift of the voltage with respect to the current. Which one is
leading?
Solution: θ = ?
θ = arctan {[ ωL - 1 ⁄ (ωC)] ⁄ R} = arctan {[ 15 * 20 - 1 ⁄ (15 * 5e-3)] ⁄ 200} deg = 55°
Or
cos (θ) = VR ⁄ V
θ = arccos (VR ⁄ V) = arccos (68.6 ⁄ 120) deg = 55°
Since the phase shift of voltage with respect to current (θ = βv - βi) is positive, the voltage
is leading.

e) Obtain a formula for the current as a function of time.
Solution: Since the voltage leads the current by θ and the phase angle of the voltage is
zero, the phase angle of the current should be -θ
θ = 55° = 55*3.14 ⁄ 180 rad = 0.96 rad; βi = 0 (because v = V sin (ωt)); i (t) = ?
θ = βv - βi
βi = βv - θ = 0 - 0.96 = -0.96
i                                                                                          (t) = I sin (ωt + βi) = 0.343 A sin (15t - 0.96)

function of time.
Solution: θR = 0; θL = π ⁄ 2; θC = -π ⁄ 2; vR (t) = ?; vL (t) = ?; vC (t) = ?
θR = βRv - βi
βRv = θR + βi = 0 + -0.96 = -0.96
vR = VR sin (ωt + βRv) = 68.6 V sin (15t - 0.96) θL = βLv - βi
βLv = θL + βi = π ⁄ 2 + -0.96 = π ⁄ 2 - 0.96
vL = VL sin (ωt + βLv) = 102.9 V sin (15t + π ⁄ 2 - 0.96) θC = βCv - βi
βCv = θC + βi = -π ⁄ 2 + -0.96 = -π ⁄ 2 - 0.96
vC = VC sin (ωt + βCv) = 4.6 V sin (15t -π ⁄ 2 - 0.96)

7.5.1                                                                                           RESONANT FREQUENCY
Te Amplitude of the current through a series connection of a resistor, an inductor
and capacitor depends on the frequency of the source, because the impedance of
the combination depends on frequency. Te frequency for which the amplitude of
the current is the maximum for a given amplitude of the voltage is called resonant
frequency of the circuit. Since I                                                               = V ⁄ Z, I is maximum when Z is minimum.
Since Z = √ {R 2 + [ωL - 1 ⁄ (ωC)] 2}, Z is minimum when ωL - 1 ⁄ (ωC) = 0. Terefore
the resonant angular frequency (ωo) is the frequency that makes this expression zero.
ωo = 1 ⁄ √ (LC)
Te resonant frequency is obtained by dividing the resonant angular frequency by 2π; that
is, fo                                                                                          = 1 ⁄ {2π √ (LC)}. Resonant frequency has a very important application in the tuning
circuits of radios, televisions and others. A tuning circuit may have a variable capacitor.
Te capacitance of the variable capacitor can be dialed so that the resonant frequency of
the tuning circuit is equal to the frequency of the signal to be picked. When signals with
different frequencies arrive on the device, only the signal whose frequency is equal to the
resonant frequency will be received with a significant current.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Te tuning circuit of a radio consists of a series combination of a 1000 Ω resistor,
0.004 H and a variable capacitor. To what capacitance should the capacitor be dialed, if
the radio is to pick a signal whose frequency is 2e6 Hz.
Solution: Te capacitance of the capacitor should be dialed to a value that makes the resonant
frequency of the tuning circuit equal to the frequency of the signal to be picked.
fo                                                                                              = 2e6 Hz; L = 0.004 H; C = ?
                                                                                                                                                                                       fo                             = 1 ⁄ {2π √ (LC)}
                                                                                                                                                                                       fo 2                           = 1 ⁄ (4π 2LC)

Te root mean square (RMS) value of an ac signal is defined to be the square root of the
average of the square of the signal. Let’s consider an ac voltage that varies with time according
to the equation v = V sin (ωt). Squaring v 2 = V 2 sin 2 (ωt). Te square of the sine can be
expanded using the double angle formula: v 2 = V 2 ⁄ 2 - V 2 cos (2ωt) ⁄ 2. Te average of
the first term is itself V 2 ⁄ 2 because it is a constant. Te average of the second term is zero
because cosine alternates between equal (numerically) positives and negatives periodically.
Terefore the RMS value (VRMS) of an ac signal is equal to the square root of V2 ⁄ 2; that
is, the RMS value of an ac signal is obtained by dividing the amplitude by √ (2).
VRMS = V ⁄ √ (2)
Similarly the RMS value of the current is given as IRMS = I ⁄ √ (2). ac voltmeters and
ammeters are designed to measure RMS values.

7.5.3                                                                                                  AVERAGE POWER
Te instantaneous power dissipated in ac circuits is given as the product of the instantaneous
voltage and instantaneous current. Suppose the current varies with time in the form
i                                                                                                      = I sin (ωt) and the phase shift of the voltage with respect to the current is θ. Ten,
the voltage is given as v = V sin (ωt) and the instantaneous power varies with time as
VI sin (ωt) sin (ωt + θ) = VI cos (θ) sin 2 (ωt) + VI sin (θ) sin (ωt) cos (ωt) (the last expression
is obtained by expanding sin (ωt + θ)). Te average of the first term is VI cos (θ) ⁄ 2 because
the average of sin 2 (ωt) is equal to 1 ⁄ 2 as obtained in the previous section. Te average
of the second term is zero because sin (ωt) cos (ωt) = sin (2ωt) ⁄ 2 whose average is zero
because sine alternates between equal (numerically) positives and negatives periodically.
Terefore, the average power (Pav) of an ac circuit is given as follows:
Pav = IV cos (θ) ⁄ 2 = IRMS VRMS cos (θ)
Te value cos (θ) is called the power factor of the circuit. Te circuit yields no power if
the phase shift of voltage with respect to current is ± pi; ⁄ 2 (because cos (π ⁄ 2) = 0). For
example, no power can be extracted from an inductor or a capacitor because their phase
shifts are π ⁄ 2 and -π ⁄ 2 respectively. Only a resistor yields power because for a resistor the
phase shift is zero and cos (0) = 1. Actually, it can be said that the power dissipated in a
series connection of a resistor, inductor and capacitor, the power dissipated in the circuit
is equal to the power dissipated in the resistor. Since cos (θ) = VR ⁄ V = IR ⁄ V, the average
power can also be written as
Pav = I 2R ⁄ 2 = IRMS 2 R

Example: A 500 Ω resistor, a 60 H inductor and a 0.006 F capacitor are connected in
series and then connected to a potential difference that varies with time according to the
equation v = 20 V sin (20t).
a) Calculate the average power dissipated in the circuit.
Solution: V = 20 V; ω = 20 rad ⁄ s; R = 500 Ω L = 60 H; C = 0.006 F; I = ? (Pav = I 2 R ⁄ 2); Pav = ?
I = V ⁄ Z = V ⁄ √ {R 2 + [ωl - 1 ⁄ (ωC)] 2} = 20 ⁄ √ {500 2 + [20 * 60 - 1 ⁄ (20 * 0.006)]
2} A = 0.015 A
Pav = I 2 R ⁄ 2 = 0.015 2 * 500 ⁄ 2 W = 0.06 W
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Calculate the average power dissipated across the resistor, inductor and capacitor.
Solution: Te power dissipated across the resistor is equal to the power dissipated in the
circuit which is 0.06 W. Te power dissipated across the inductor is zero because the
phase shift of voltage with respect to current is π ⁄ 2. Te average power dissipated across
the capacitor is zero because the phase shift of the voltage with respect to current is -π ⁄ 2.

8.1                                                                                                THE HISTORY OF LIGHT
In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton stated that light is made up of corpuscles (particles).
But later it was found out that light displays wave properties, and Christian Huygens stated
that light is a wave. In the mid nineteenth century, Maxwell developed the four equations of
electricity and magnetism known as Maxwell’s equations. Based on these equations, Maxwell
showed that light is a small subset of a large group of waves called electromagnetic waves.
Tis established the wave nature of light firmly. But in the late nineteenth century and early
twentieth century, some experiments that contradicted classical physics were done. Tese
were the black body radiation experiment, the photoelectric experiment and the Michelson-
Morley experiment. Max Planck found out that the findings of the black body radiation
can be explained only if he assumes that light is propagated in the form of particles. His
assumptions were confirmed by subsequent experiments mainly the photoelectric experiment.
Te current understanding of light is that light is both a particle and wave. Tis means in
some experiments it behaves like a wave and in some experiments like a particle. Tis is
called the dual property of light.
8.1.1                                                                                              THE WAVE NATURE OF LIGHT
Te wave nature of light is best described by means of Maxwell’s equations. Maxwell’s
equations are four equations that encompass the vast experimental findings of electricity
and magnetism. Te first equation is a representation of Coulomb’s law which deals with
the force between charged objects. Te second equation is a mathematical representation of
the fact that magnetic field lines form complete loops. Te third equation is a representation
of Ampere’s law modified by theoretical prediction of Maxwell. Ampere’s Law states that
current gives rise to magnetic field and Maxwell’s theoretical prediction states a time varying
electric field produces magnetic field. Te fourth equation is a representation of Faraday’s
law which states that a time varying magnetic field produces electric field or induced emf.
By combining these equations, Maxwell was able to predict that whenever a charge is
accelerated, electromagnetic wave is propagated. Tis theoretical prediction was tested for
the first time by the German scientist by the name Hertz (the unit of frequency was named
Hertz in honor of this scientist) who produced electromagnetic waves by accelerating charges.
Tis was put into practical application for the first time by the Italian inventor Marconi
who invented the radio. Today electromagnetic waves are a part of our daily life. Radio
signals, television signals, cellphone signals and others are carried by electromagnetic waves.

All electromagnetic waves have the same speed which is the speed of light. Te speed of
light (c) in vacuum is 3e8 m ⁄ s.
c = 3e8 m ⁄ s
Electromagnetic waves are classified according to their wavelengths. Te range of wavelengths
that produce sensation of vision are called light waves. Te range of wavelengths that produce
sensation of heat are called infrared waves. Te range of wavelengths that are used to carry
radio signals are called radio waves. Other examples include x-rays (used in medicine to
obtain pictures of internal body parts), ultraviolet rays (which produces vitamin D in our
bodies) and Gamma radiation (which is the most energetic radiation).
Te physical quantities that vary as a function of position and time for electromagnetic waves
are electric field and magnetic field. Te electric field and the magnetic field are perpendicular
to each other and to the direction of propagation of energy. Since electromagnetic waves
are waves, they satisfy the wave equation.
c = f λ
Where f is frequency and λ is wavelength.
Example: Violet light has a wavelength of 400 nm. Calculate its frequency.
Solution: λ = 400 nm = 400e-9 m = 4e-7 m.; f = ?
f                                                                                                   = c ⁄ λ = 3e8 ⁄ 4e-7 Hz = 7.5e14 Hz

Te black body radiation experiment is an experiment that studied the intensity distribution
of the different wavelengths emitted by a hot object. A graph of intensity as a function of
wavelength was obtained. Classical physics failed to explain the results of this experiment.
Max Planck has to state the following two postulates to explain the experiment:
1. Light is propagated in the form of particles called photons.
2. Te energy of a photon is directly proportional to the frequency of light.

If E is the energy of a photon and f is the frequency of the light, then
E = h f
h is a universal constant called Planck’s constant. Its value is 6.6e-34 Js.
h = 6.6e-34 Js
For light containing a number of photons, the total energy is obtained by multiplying the
energy of one photon by the number of photons.
En = nh f
Where n is the number of photons and En is the energy of n photons. Max Planck’s postulates
were confirmed by the findings of the photoelectric experiment which was explained by
Albert Einstein. Tese postulate gave rise to the formation of a new branch of physics called
quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics has been used successfully at the atomic level.

Reflection of light is the bouncing of light from a surface. Te light ray that hits the surface
is called incident ray. Te light ray reflected from the surface is called the reflected ray. Te
line perpendicular to the surface at the point of impact is called the normal line. Te angle
formed between the incident ray and the normal line is called the angle of incidence. Te angle
formed between the reflected ray and the normal line is called the angle of reflection. Te law
of reflection states that the angle of incidence (θi) and the angle of reflection (θr) are equal.
θi = θr
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A light ray is incident on a flat mirror. Te angle formed between the surface of
the mirror and the incident ray is 25°. Calculate the angle of reflection.
Solution: Since the angle of incidence is angle formed with the normal and the incident ray
makes an angle of 25° with the surface, the angle of incidence is 90° - 25° = 65°.
θi = 65°; θr = ?
θr = θi = 65°

Example: Two mirrors are connected at an angle of 120°. A light ray is incident on one of the
mirrors at an angle of incidence of 70°. Calculate its angle of reflection on the second mirror.
Solution: Since the angle of incidence on the first mirror is 70°, the angle of reflection on
the first mirror is 70°. Te angle formed between the surface of the first mirror and the
reflected ray is 90° - 70° = 20°. Te reflected ray will continue to hit the second mirror
and reflected. Te two surfaces of the mirror and the path of the light ray from the first
to the second mirror form a triangle. Te angle formed between the second mirror and
the light ray incident on the second mirror is 180° - (120° + 20°) = 40°. Te angle of
incidence on the second mirror is 90° - 40° = 50°. Terefore the angle of reflection on
the second mirror is 50°.

Refraction is the bending of light as light crosses the boundary between two mediums. Te
light ray incident on the boundary is called incident ray. Te ray past the boundary is called
the refracted ray. Te line that is perpendicular to the boundary at the point of impact is
called the normal line. Te angle formed between the incident ray and the normal line is
called the angle of incidence. Te angle formed between the refracted ray and the normal
line is called the angle of refraction.
As light enters a medium from a vacuum (or approximately air), the speed and the wavelength
of the light decrease while the frequency remains the same. Te ratio between the speed
of light (c) in vacuum and the speed of light (v) in a medium is called the refractive index
(n) of the medium.
n = c ⁄ v
Refractive index is unit-less. From this definition of refractive index, it is clear that the
refractive index (na) of vacuum (air) is one and the refractive index of any other medium
is greater than one. Te refractive index of water (nw) and glass (ng) are 4 ⁄ 3 and 3 ⁄ 2
respectively. If the wavelength of light is λv in vacuum and λm in a medium, since frequency
remains the same n = c ⁄ v = fλv ⁄ (fλm) and
n = λv ⁄ λm

ELECTRICITY, MAGNETISM, OPTICS
AND MODERN PHYSICS                                                                                 Light and Optics
Snell’s law (law of refraction) states that the ratio between the sine of the angle of incidence
and the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio between the speeds of light in
the respective mediums. If light enters medium 2 from medium 1 at an angle of incidence
θ1 and the angle of refraction in medium 2 is θ2, then sin (θ1) ⁄ sin (θ2) = v1 ⁄ v2 = (c ⁄ n1)
⁄                                                                                                  (c ⁄ n2) = n2 ⁄ n1. Terefore, Snell’s can be mathematically expresses as
n1 sin (θ1) = n2 sin (θ2)
It can be easily deduced from this equation that light bends towards the normal as it enters
an optically denser (higher refractive index) medium and bends away from the normal as
it enters an optically less dense medium. A light ray perpendicular to the boundary passes
straight unbent.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A light ray enters water (from air) at an angle of incidence 56°. Calculate the
angle of refraction in water.
Solution: na = 1; nw = 4 ⁄ 3; θa = 56°; θw = ?
na sin (θa) = nw sin (θw)
sin (θw) = na sin (θa) ⁄ nw = 1 * sin (56°) ⁄ (4 ⁄ 3) = 0.62
θw = arcsin (0.62) = 38.3°
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: A light ray enters water (from air) on glass at an angle of incidence of 65°.
Calculate the refraction angle in glass (Te air-water boundary and the water-glass boundary
are parallel).
Solution: First the angle of refraction in water should be calculated from the air-water
boundary. Te angle of refraction in water and the angle of incidence on the water-glass
boundary are equal because they are alternate interior angles. Ten the angle of refraction
in glass can be obtained from the water-glass boundary.

8.5                                                                                                 DISPERSION OF LIGHT
Dispersion is the separation of white light into different colors as light enters a medium
from air. White light is composed of seven different colors. Arranged in increasing
order of wavelength, these are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red
(Abbreviated as VIBGYOR). Violet has the shortest wavelength and red has the longest
wavelength. Te reason white separates into its component colors as light enters a medium
is because the refractive index of a medium depends on the wavelength of the light. Te
refractive index increases as the wavelength decreases. Tat is, violet has the largest refractive
index and red has the smallest refractive index. According to Snell’s law, the greater the
refractive index the smaller the angle of refraction or the greater the deviation angle from
the path of the incident light. Tus, as light enters a medium from air, violet light will be
bent by the largest angle and red light will be bent by the smallest angle.
A good example of dispersion is the rainbow. Rainbow happens because the cloud has
different refractive indexes for the different colors of light.
Example: White light enters glass (from air) at an angle of incidence of 65°. Te refractive
indices of the glass for violet and red light are respectively 1.52 and 1.48. Calculate the
angle formed between red light and violet light after refraction.
Solution: θa =65°; na = 1; ngr = 1.48; ngv = 1.52; θ = θgr - θgv = ?
nnr sin (θgr) = na sin (θa)
sin (θgr) = na sin (θa) ⁄ ngr = 1 * sin (65°) ⁄ 1.48 = 0.612
θgr = arcsin (0.612) = 37.8°
nnv sin (θgv) = na sin (θa)
sin (θgv) = na sin (θa) ⁄ ngv = 1 * sin (65°) ⁄ 1.52 = 0.596
θgv = arcsin (0.596) = 36.6°
θ = θgr - θgv = 37.8° - 36.6° = 1.2°

8.6                                                                                                TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION
As light enters an optically less dense medium, it bends away from the normal. As the angle
of incidence in the denser medium is increased, for a certain angle the angle of refraction
will be 90°; that is, the light ray will be refracted parallel to the boundary. Te angle of
incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction is 90° is called the critical
angle (θc) of the boundary. If the refractive indexes of the less dense and more dense medium
are n< and n> respectively, then n> sin (θc) = n< sin (90°) = n<; and the critical angle of the
boundary is given as follows.
θc = arcsin (n< ⁄ n>)
For angles of incidence less than the critical angle, both reflection and refraction take
place. Te fact that we can see our face in water indicates that some of the light rays are
reflected; and the fact that we can see objects inside water indicates that some of the light
rays are refracted. But for angles greater than the critical angle, only reflection takes place.
Total internal reflection is a phenomenon where only reflection takes place at the boundary
between two mediums and occurs only when light enters a less dense medium at an angle
of incidence greater than the critical angle.
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Calculate the critical angle for the boundary formed between
a) air and water.
Solution: n< = na = 1; n> = nw = 4 ⁄ 3; θc = ?
θc = arcsin (n< ⁄ n>) = 48.6°
_______________________________________________________________________
b) water and glass.
Solution: n< = nw = 4 ⁄ 3; n> = ng = 1.5; θc = ?
θc = arcsin (n< ⁄ n>) = 62.8°

Example: A light source is placed in water at a depth of 0.5 m. Calculate the radius of a
circular region at the surface of the water from which light rays come out.
Solution: Light rays from the light source will hit the air-water boundary at different angles
of incidence. Only the light rays whose angle of incidence is less than the critical angle can
be refracted into air. Te light rays whose angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle
will be reflected back because total internal reflection takes place. Because of this, light rays
will come out of a certain circular region of the surface only. Te angle of incidence for the
light rays that fall on the boundary of this circular region is equal to the critical angle of
the boundary. Te radius can be calculated from the right angled triangle formed by a line
connecting the source with the center of the circle (a), the line that connects the center of
the circle to a point on the boundary of the circular region (r) and the line connecting the
source to the point on the boundary. Te first two lines are perpendicular to each other and
the angle formed between the last two lines is the critical angle. Tus θc = arctan (r ⁄ a).

n< = na = 1; n> = nw = 4 ⁄ 3; a = 0.5 m; r = ?
θc = arcsin (n< ⁄ n>) = arcsin (1 ⁄ (4 ⁄ 3)) = 48.6°
tan (θc) = r ⁄ a
r = a tan (θc) = 0.5 * tan (48.6°) = 0.57 m

Example A light ray is incident on one of the legs of a                                                  45° right angled glass prism
perpendicularly. Trace the path of the light ray.
Solution: Since the light ray is perpendicular to the surface (angle of incidence zero), it will enter
undeflected. Ten it will be incident on the glass-air boundary on the larger face (hypotenuse).
Since it is a 45° prism, from simple geometry, it can be shown that the angle of incidence
on this boundary is 45°. Since the light ray is incident on the denser medium (glass), what
happens depends on the critical angle of the boundary. If the critical angle is greater than 45°
it can be refracted. But if the critical angle is less than 45°, total internal reflection will take
place and the light ray will be incident on the other leg of the prism perpendicularly (as can
be shown by simple geometry) and will be refracted to air undeflected.
n< = na = 1; n> = ng = 1.5; θc = ?
θc = arcsin (n< ⁄ n>) = arcsin (1 ⁄ 1.5) = 41.8°
Since the critical angle is less than the angle of incidence at the hypotenuse, total internal
reflection takes place and the light ray is incident on the other leg perpendicularly and is
reflected to air undeflected.

Your goals for this chapter are to learn about the properties of the images formed by mirrors
and lenses.
An image of a point formed by a mirror is the point at which light rays from the point
converge or seem to converge after reflection. An image of a point formed by a lens
(a piece of glass with spherical surfaces) is the point at which light rays from the point
converge or seem to converge after refraction. Tere are two kinds of images: real and virtual.
A real image is an image where actual light rays converge. A real image can be captured in a
screen. An example is an image formed by a cinema projector. A virtual image is an image
where actual light rays do not converge but seem to converge. A virtual image cannot be
captured in a screen. An example is an image formed by a flat mirror.

Te following diagram shows image formation by a flat mirror.
Figure 9.1
Te image formed by a flat mirror has the following properties.
1. It is a virtual image.
2. It is located behind the mirror.
3. It has the same size as the object. Its perpendicular distance from the mirror is
equal to the perpendicular distance of the object from the mirror.
4. It is erect (not inverted) in a direction parallel to the mirror.
5. It is laterally inverted. In other words the image is inverted in a direction perpendicular
to the mirror. For example the image of an arrow pointing towards the mirror is
an arrow pointing towards the arrow itself.

Te center of the spherical surface is called the center of curvature (point C in the diagram)
of the mirror. Te midpoint of the mirror is called the center of the mirror (point O in the
diagram). Te line joining the center of curvature and the center of the mirror is called
the principal axis of the mirror. Te point at which light rays parallel to the principal axis
converge after reflection is called the focus (point F in the diagram) of the mirror. Te
focus of a concave mirror is real because actual light rays meet at the point. Te focus is
located midway between the center of curvature and the center of the mirror. Te distance
between the focus and the center of the mirror is called the focal length (f  ) of the mirror.
Only two light rays originating from a point are needed to construct its image. Te image
is the point at which these light rays converge or seem to converge after reflection. Tere
are 3 special light rays that can be used when constructing an image.
1. A light ray parallel to the principal axis is reflected through the focus.
2. A light ray through the focus is reflected parallel to the principal axis.
3. A light ray through the center of curvature returns in its own path.
Te following diagram shows the construction of the image formed by a concave mirror
when the object is placed beyond the center of curvature.

A convex mirror is a spherical mirror with the outside surface being the reflecting surface.
Te following diagram shows a convex mirror.
Figure 9.6
Te center of the spherical surface is called the center of curvature (point C on the diagram)
of the mirror. Te mid-point of the mirror is called the center of the mirror (point O on
the diagram). Te line joining the center of curvature and the center of the mirror is called
the principal axis of the mirror. Te point from which light rays parallel to the principal
axis seem to come from after reflection is called the focus (point F on the diagram) of the
mirror. Te focus of a convex mirror is virtual because actual light rays do not meet at
the focus. Te focus is located midway between the center of curvature and the center of
the mirror. Te distance between the focus and the center of the mirror is called the focal
length (f  ) of the mirror.

Te mirror equation is an equation that relates the distance of the object from the center
of the mirror, the distance of the image from the center of the mirror and the focal length
(distance between focus and the center of the mirror). Te distance between the object and
the center of the mirror is called object distance (p). It is taken to be positive if the object
is real and negative if the object is virtual. A virtual object is possible when more than one
mirrors are involved. Te distance between the image and the center of the mirror is called
the image distance (q). Te image distance is taken to be positive if the image is real and
negative if the image is virtual. Te focal length (f  ) is taken to be positive if the focus is
real and negative if the focus is virtual. Tus, the focal length of a concave mirror is positive
since its focus is real and that of a convex mirror is negative because its focus is virtual. Te
focal length of a mirror is half the radius of curvature: |f  | = R ⁄ 2 where R is the radius of
curvature of the mirror. Te following equation is the mirror equation.
1 ⁄ f = 1 ⁄ p + 1 ⁄ q

AND MODERN PHYSICS                                                                               Mirrors and Lenses
Te magnification (M) of a mirror is defined to be the ratio between the size of the image
(hi) and the size of the object (ho). Te size of the object (image) is taken to be positive if
the object (image) is erect and negative if the object (image) is inverted.
M = hi ⁄ ho
It can also be shown that the magnification is equal to the negative of the ratio between
image distance and object distance.
M = - q ⁄ p
_______________________________________________________________________
Example: An object of height 0.02 m is placed 0.4 m in front of a concave mirror whose
radius of curvature is 0.1 m.
a) Determine its focal length.
Solution: Te focal length of a concave mirror is positive.
R = 0.1 m; f = ?
|f  |                                                                                            = R ⁄ 2 = 0.1 ⁄ 2 m = 0.05 m
f                                                                                                = 0.05 m
_______________________________________________________________________
b) Calculate the distance of the image from the mirror.
Solution: p = 0.4 m; q = ?
1 ⁄ f = 1 ⁄ p + 1 ⁄ q
1 ⁄ q = 1 ⁄ f - 1 ⁄ p = (1 ⁄ 0.05 - 1 ⁄ 0.4) 1 ⁄ m = 17.5 1 ⁄ m
q = 1 ⁄ 17.5 m = 0.06 m
_______________________________________________________________________
c) Is the image real or virtual?
Solution: Te image is real because the image distance is positive.

d) Calculate the magnification.
Solution: M = ?
M = - q ⁄ p = - 0.06 ⁄ 0.4 = -0.15
_______________________________________________________________________
e) Calculate the size of the image.
Solution: ho = 0.02 m; hi = ?
M = hi ⁄ ho
hi = Mho = -0.15 * 0.02 m = 0.-003 m
_______________________________________________________________________
f) Is the image erect or inverted?
Solution: Te image is inverted because hi is negative.

Te mid-point of the lens (point C in the diagram) is called the center of the lens.
Te line joining the centers of curvature of both surfaces and the center of the lens is called
the principal axis of the lens. Te point at which light rays parallel to the principal axis
converge after refraction is called the focus (point F on the diagram) of the lens. Te focus
of a convex lens is real because actual light rays meet at the point. Te distance between
the focus and the center of the lens is called the focal length of the lens.
Tere are three special light rays that can be used to construct images formed by a convex lens.
1. A light ray parallel to the principal axis passes through the focal point after refraction.
2. A light ray through the focal point is refracted parallel to the principal axis.
3. A light ray through the center of the lens passes undeflected.

Te lens equation is an equation that relates the object distance, image distance and the
focal length. Te object distance (p) is the distance between the object and the center of the
lens. It is taken to be positive if the object is real and negative if the object is virtual. Te
image distance (q) is the distance between the image and the center of the lens. It is taken
to be positive if the image is real and negative if the image is virtual. Te focal length (f  )
is the distance between the focal point and the center of the lens. Te focal length is taken
to be positive if the focus is real and negative if the focus is virtual. Tis means the focal
length of a convex lens is positive (because its focus is real) and that of a concave lens is
negative (because its focus is virtual). Te following equation is the so called lens equation.
1 ⁄ f = 1 ⁄ p + 1 ⁄ q
Te magnification of a lens is defined to be the ratio between the size of the image (hi)
and the size of the object (ho). Te size of the object (image) is taken to be positive if the
object (image) is erect and negative if the object (image) is inverted.

Example: An object of of height 0.03 m is placed 0.3 m in front of a concave lens whose
focal length is 0.06 m.
a) Calculate the distance of the image from the center of the lens.
Solution: Te focal length is negative because the lens is concave.
f = -0.06 m; p = 0.3 m; q = ?
1 ⁄ q = 1 ⁄ f - 1 ⁄ p = (1 ⁄ (-0.06) - 1 ⁄ 0.3) m -1 = -20 m -1

If the radius of curvature of the surface of a lens upon which the light rays are incident is
R1 and the radius of curvature of the other surface is R2, then the focal length of the lens
is given by
1 ⁄ f = (n - 1) (1 ⁄ R1 - 1 ⁄ R2)
Where n is the refractive index of the lens. A radius of curvature of the surface of a lens
is taken to be positive if the direction from the surface towards the center of curvature of
the surface is the same as the direction of the incident light rays and negative if opposite
to the direction of the incident light rays.

Example: Both surfaces of a convex lens have a radius of curvature of 0.05 m. Te refractive
index of the glass is 1.5. Calculate the focal length of the lens.
Solution: Te radius of curvature of the surface upon which the light rays are incident (R1)
is positive because the direction from the surface towards its center of curvature is the same
as the direction of the incident light rays. Te radius of curvature of the other surface is
negative because the direction from the surface to its center of curvature is opposite to the
direction of the incident light rays.
n = 1.5; R1 = 0.05 m; R2 = -0.05 m; f = ?
1 ⁄ f = (n - 1) (1 ⁄ R1 - 1 ⁄ R2) = (1.5 - 1) * (1 ⁄ 0.05 - 1 ⁄ -0.05) m -1 = 1 ⁄ 0.05 m -1

_______________________________________________________________________
Example: Both surfaces of a concave lens have a radius of curvature of 0.04 m. Te refractive
index of the glass is 1.5. Calculate the focal length of the lens.
Solution: Te radius of curvature of the surface upon which the light rays are incident (R1)
is negative because the direction from the surface towards its center of curvature is opposite
to the direction of the incident light rays. Te radius of curvature of the other surface is
positive because the direction from the surface to its center of curvature is the same as the
direction of the incident light rays.
n = 1.5; R1 = -0.04 m; R2 = 0.05 m; f = ?
1 ⁄ f = (n - 1) (1 ⁄ R1 - 1 ⁄ R2) = (1.5 - 1) * (1 ⁄ -0.04 - 1 ⁄ 0.04) m -1 = -1 ⁄ 0.04 m -1

10 WAVE PROPERTIES OF LIGHT
Your goals for this chapter are to learn about interference of light, diffraction of light, and
polarization of light.
10.1 INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT
Interference of Light is the meeting of two or more light waves at the same point at the
same time. Te net instantaneous effect of the interfering waves is obtained by adding
the instantaneous values of the waves algebraically. Te net effect of the interfering waves
y1 = A1 cos(ωt -kx1) and y2 = A2 cos (ωt - kx2 ) is given as ynet = y1 + y2 = A1 cos(ωt -kx1) +
A2 cos (ωt - kx2 ).
Constructive interference is interference with the maximum possible effect. For light waves,
constructive interference results in a bright spot. Te amplitude of the net wave of two
interfering waves is equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the interfering waves. It occurs
when the phase shift (δ) between the interfering waves is an integral multiple of                 2π.
Te following equation is the condition for constructive interference.
δn = 2nπ

Where n is an integer; that is, n is a member of the set {… -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …} and δn is a
member of the set {… -4π, -2π, 0, 2π, 4π, …}.
Destructive interference is interference with the minimum possible effect. For light waves,
destructive interference results in a dark spot. Te amplitude of the net wave of two interfering
waves is equal to the difference between the amplitudes of the interfering waves. It occurs
when the phase shift between the interfering waves is an odd-integral multiple of π. Te
following equation is the condition for destructive interference.
δn = (2n + 1)π
Where n is integer; that is n is a member of the set {… -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …} and
δn is a member of the set {… -3π, -π, π, 3π, …}.
Example: Determine if the following waves will interfere constructively, destructively, or
neither constructively nor destructively.
a) y1 = 5 cos (20t + π) and y2 = 7 cos (20t + 4π).
Solution: β1 = π; β2 = 4π; δ = ?
δ = β2 - β1 = 4π - π = 3π
Te two waves will interfere destructively because δ = 3π is a member of the set {… -3π,
-π, π, 3π, …}
y1 = 30 cos (40t + π ⁄ 2) and y2 = 80 cos (40t + 7π).
Solution: β1 = π ⁄ 2; β2 = 7π; δ = ?
δ = β2 - β1 = 7π - π ⁄ 2 = 13π ⁄ 2
Te two waves will interfere neither constructively nor destructively because δ = 13π/2
is not a member of the set {… -3π, -π, π, 3π, …} or the set {… -4π, -2π, 0, 2π, 4π, …}
y1 = 2 cos (50t - 5π ⁄ 2) and y2 = 80 cos (50t - π ⁄ 2).
Solution: β1 = -5π ⁄ 2; β2 = -π ⁄ 2; δ = ?
δ = β2 - β1 = -π ⁄ 2 - -5π ⁄ 2 = 2π

Te two waves will interfere constructively because δ = 2π is a member of the set
{… -4π, -2π, 0, 2π, 4π, …}
Te conditions of constructive and destructive interference can also be expressed in
terms of the path difference (difference between the distances travelled by the two waves)
between the two waves. If the two interfering waves are given as y1 = A1 cos (ωt - kx1) and
y = A2 cos (ωt - kx2) (where k = 2π ⁄ λ), then the phase shift between the two waves is
δ = 2πx2 ⁄ λ - 2πx1 ⁄ λ = (2π ⁄ λ)(x2 - x1) = (2π ⁄ λ)Δ where Δ = x2 - x1 is the path difference
between the two waves. Te condition of constructive interference may be written in
terms of path difference as δn = 2nπ = (2π ⁄ λ)Δn. Tis implies that the path difference
between two waves has to satisfy the following condition for constructive interference.
Δn = nλ
Where n is an integer; that is n is a member of the set {… -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …} and Δn is
a member of the set {… -2λ, -λ, 0, λ, 2λ, …}. Two waves will interfere constructively if
their path difference is an integral multiple of the wavelength of the waves.
Te condition of destructive interference can be written in terms of path difference as
δn = (2n + 1)π = (2π ⁄ λ)Δn. Tis implies that the path difference between two waves has
to satisfy the following condition if the waves are to interfere destructively.
Δn = (n + 1 ⁄ 2)λ
where n is integer; that is n is a member of the set {… -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …} and Δn is a
member of the set {… -3λ ⁄ 2, -λ ⁄ 2, λ ⁄ 2, 3λ ⁄ 2, …}. Two waves will interfere destructively
if their path difference is half-odd-integral multiple of the wavelength.
10.1.1 DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT
Diffraction of light is the bending of light as light encounters an obstacle. Light travels in a
straight line. But when light encounters an obstacle it scatters in all directions. When light
is blocked by an opaque object, it can be still seen behind the opaque object because of
diffraction of light at the edges of the object. A large part of a room can be seen through
a key hole even though light travels in straight lines. Tis is because of diffraction of light
at the key hole which bends the light. Tis property of light enables one to use a narrow
slit as a source of light because as light crosses the slit it is scattered in all directions.

Young’s double slit experiment consists of an opaque material with two very narrow slits
(s1 and s2 in the diagram) and a screen at some distance from this material. When the
opaque material is exposed to a source of light, the two slits serve as two sources of light
because light is diffracted in all directions as it passes through the slits. Te light waves
from the two slits interfere on the screen. Te diagram shows light waves from the two slits
interfering at point B. Te experiment shows that bright (constructive interference) and
dark (destructive interference) spots appear alternatively on the screen. Te graph on the
screen is a representation of the intensity of light observed on the screen. Te interference
pattern observed on the screen depends on the path difference between the two waves. If
the path difference is an integral multiple of the wavelength of the light, the two waves
interfere constructively and a bright spot is observed. If the path difference is half-odd-
integral multiple of the wavelength of the light, destructive interference takes place and a
dark spot is observed. At the center of the screen the two waves travell the same distance
and the path difference is zero which implies constructive interference and a bright spot
is observed. Tis corresponds to n = 0 and is called the zeroth order. As one goes further
from the center, the path difference between the waves increases. At a point where the
path difference is half of the wavelength, destructive interference takes place and a dark
spot is observed. Tis way, as the path difference alternates between integral multiples of
the wavelength and half-odd-integral multiples of the wavelength, the interference pattern
alternates between bright spots and dark spots. Te n th bright spot is called the n th order
bright spot.
Te path difference between the waves from slit s1 and slit s2 can be obtained by dropping
the perpendicular from slit s1 to the light wave from slit s2 (the line joining slit s1 and point
A in the diagram). Ten the path difference (δ) is the distance between slit s2 and point A.
If the distance between the slits is d and the angle formed between the line joining the slits
and the line joining slit s1 and point A is θ (Tis angle is also equal to the angle formed
by the line joining the midpoint of the slits to point B with the horizontal), then the path
difference is given as δ = d sin (θ). Terefore the condition for constructive interference
(bright spot) for Young’s double slit experiment is
d sin (θ) = nλ
Where n is an integer and λ is the wavelength of the light. Similarly, the condition for
destructive interference (dark spot) is
d sin (θ) = (n + 1 ⁄ 2)λ

If the perpendicular distance between the source and the screen is D, then the vertical
distance (y) between the the center of the screen (zeroth order bright spot) and an order
corresponding to an angle θ is given by
y = D tan (θ)
Example: In Young’s double slit experiment, the slits are separated by a distance of 2e-6 m.
Te second order bright spot is observed at an angle of 26°.
a) Calculate the wavelength of the light.
Solution: d = 2e-9 m; θ = 26°; n = 2; λ = ?
d sin (θ) = nλ
λ = d sin (θ) ⁄ 2 = 2e-6 * sin (26°) ⁄ 2 m = 4.4e-9 m
b) If the perpendicular distance between the source and the screen is 0.05 m, calculate
the distance between the zeroth order bright spot and the second order bright spot
on the screen.
Solution: D = 0.05 m; θ = 26°; y = ?
y = D tan (θ)
y = 0.05 * tan (26°) = 0.024 m
10.1.3 THIN FILM INTERFERENCE
When light of wavelength λ is incident on a thin film of refractive index n, some of the light
rays will be reflected from the upper surface, and some of the light rays will be refracted
to the lower surface and reflected from the lower surface and then refracted back to air.
Tese two light rays will interfere and create interference pattern. Tere are two factors that
contribute to the phase difference between the two waves:
a) the path difference between the two waves. If the thickness of the film is t and the
incident light rays are approximately perpendicular to the surface, the path difference
is                                                                                               2t. Since the wavelength of the light in the film is λ ⁄ n, this corresponds to a
phase difference of 2π(2t ⁄ (λ ⁄ n)) radians = 2π(2tn ⁄ λ) radians.

b) the phase difference due to phase shift on reflection from an optically denser
medium. Te light rays reflected from the upper surface will have a phase shift of
π radians because they are being reflected from an optically denser medium (film)
while the light rays reflected from the lower surface will not have a phase shift,
because they are being reflected from an optically less dense medium (air). Tus,
the two waves will have a phase shift of π radians due to reflection.
Terefore the net phase difference between the two waves is 2π(2nt ⁄ λ) + π. Tis implies
that the condition for constructive interference is 2π(2nt ⁄ λ) + π = 2mπ where m is a
natural number, or
2nt = (m - 1 ⁄ 2) λ
Similarly, the condition for destructive interference is 2π(2nt ⁄ λ) + π = (2m + 1) π where
m is a natural number, or
2nt = m λ

2nt = (m - 1 ⁄ 2) λ
t                                                                                                 = (m - 1 ⁄ 2) λ ⁄ (2n) = (2 - 1 ⁄ 2) * 7e-9 ⁄ (2 * 1.3) m = 4.038e-7 m.
10.1.4 SINGLE SLIT DIFFRACTION
When light enters a slit whose width is of the same order as the wavelength of the light,
it will be diffracted and each point of the slit can be considered as a source of light. Te
light waves from each point of the slit meet on a screen and form interference pattern.
Te interference of all of the waves can be regrouped into pairs of waves and then added.
Imagine the slit being divided into half. If the width of the slit is a, for every wave in the
lower half, there is a wave in the upper half at a distance of a ⁄ 2. If the waves are grouped
into pairs of waves with the distance between their sources being a ⁄ 2, then the condition
for destructive (constructive) interference becomes the same for all of the pairs, and thus
the condition of interference can be applied to one of the pairs only. As discussed earlier,
if the distance between the sources is a ⁄ 2, then the path difference between the waves is a
sin (θ) ⁄ 2 where θ is defined in the same way as above. Terefore there will be destructive
interference, if the path difference is equal to half of the wavelength or if a sin (θ) = λ. Te
same argument can be repeated by imagining the slit to be divided into 2, 4, … N parts
and regrouping the waves into pairs of waves whose sources are separated by a distance of
a ⁄ N and the following general formula for destructive interference can be obtained.
a sin (θ) = nλ
Where n is an integer.

10.1.5 DIFFRACTION GRATING
A diffraction grating is a piece of glass with a lot of slits spaced uniformly. Again we can
imagine the waves being grouped into pairs before being added. If each slit is grouped with
the slit next to it, then the distance between the slits for each pair of waves will be the
same (which is the distance between two neighboring slits). Tis means the condition of
interference is the same for all of the pairs of waves. As a result the condition of interference
can be applied to one of the pairs only. If the slits are separated by a distance d, then the
path difference between the waves of a pair is d sin (θ) (with θ as defined above). Terefore,
the conditions of constructive and destructive interference respectively are
d sin (θ) = nλ
d sin (θ) = (n + 1 ⁄ 2) λ
Where n is an integer.
Example: A diffraction grating has 10000 slits. Its width is 0.02 m. When a certain light
wave is diffracted through it, the first bright spot was observed at an angle of 16°. Calculate,
the wavelength of the light.
Solution: Te separation between the slits (d) may be obtained by dividing the width of the
diffraction grating by the number of slits.
Width = 0.02 m, number of slits = 1000; d = 0.02/10000 m = 2e-6 m; θ = 16°; n = 1; λ = ?
d sin (θ) = nλ
λ = d sin (θ) ⁄ n = 2e-6 * sin (16°) ⁄ n = 5.5e-7 m

10.2 POLARIZATION
Electromagnetic waves (light is an electromagnetic wave) are transverse waves which means
the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of energy.
Tis limits the direction of the electric field to the plane perpendicular to the direction
of propagation of energy. But it can have any direction on that plane. Normally light will
include electric fields with all of the possible directions (because light is produced with
charges accelerating in no preferred direction). Such kind of light is called an unpolarized
light. But when light passes through some materials (devices) called polarizers, there will be
a preferred direction and the electric field will vibrate in a certain fixed direction. Such light
where the electric field fibrates only in a certain fixed direction is called linearly polarized light.
Polarized light may be created by selective absorption. Tere are some materials whose
molecules vibrate only in a certain direction. When light passes through such kind of
materials, the component of the electric field in the direction of vibration of the molecules
will be absorbed because it will be used to accelerate the charges. Only the perpendicular
component (which has a unique direction because to start with the directions were limited
to a plane) will pass through unaffected. As a result the outcome is light where the electric
field vibrates in a fixed direction which is linearly polarized light.

Polarized light also may be created by reflection. When light is incident on a boundary between
two mediums some of the light will be refracted and some of the light will be reflected. Te
component of the electric field parallel to the surface and the component perpendicular to
the surface reflect differently. Te component parallel to the surface reflects more strongly.
In fact, at a certain angle of incidence θp, where the reflected ray and the refracted ray
are perpendicular to each other, the refracted ray will contain only the component parallel
to the surface resulting in a polarized light. For this special incident rays, the sum of the
angle of incidence (θp) and angle of refraction (θr) is 90°. Or, θr = 90° - θp. Assuming the
light ray is entering a medium of refractive index n2 from a medium of refractive index
n1, n2 ⁄ n1 = sin (θp) ⁄ sin (90° - θp) = sin (θp) / cos (θp) = tan (θp). Tis special angle of
incidence that results in a purely polarized light is called polarizing angle and is given by
θp = arctan (n2 / n1)
Tis relationship is called Brewster’s law.

Your goals for this experiment are to learn about relativity, Planck’s postulates, photoelectric

11.1 THE HISTORY OF MODERN PHYSICS
Physics developed before early 1900s is called classical physics. Classical physics is largely the
physics developed by Isaac Newton (mechanics) and Karl Maxwell (electromagnetic theory).
Te physics developed after early 1900s is called modern physics.
In the late 1800s physicists pretty much felt they knew everything they need to know about
physics. But in the late 1800s and early 1900s some experiments were done which classical
physics failed to explain. Tese experiments gave rise to the emergence of a new kind of
physics. Tese experiments were the Michelson-Morley experiment, the blackbody radiation
experiment, and the photoelectric experiment.

11.2 THE MICHELSON-MORLEY EXPERIMENT
According to classical physics theory of transformation (Galilean transformation), if light is
emitted by a source moving with a speed v, the speed of light is expected to increase by v;
that is the speed of light is expected to be c + v where c = 3e8 m ⁄ s. But the Michelson-
Morley experiment found out that the speed of light is independent of the speed of the
source; that is, it is always                                                                    3e8 m ⁄ s whatever the speed of its source might be. Tus,
Galilean transformation had to be modified. To accommodate for this new experimental
finding Albert Einstein developed a new theory called Special Teory of Relativity based on
the following two postulates:
1. Te speed of light is independent of the speed of the source.
2. All coordinate systems moving with a constant velocity with respect to each other
are equivalent.
Tis theory led to some conclusions that contradicted common sense but which were later
proved to be correct. Some of these were
a) Mass and energy are equivalent and interchangeable. If a sample of mass m is
completely converted to energy, the amount of energy (E) is related with the mass
(m) by
E = mc 2
Where c is the speed of light. In atomic and nuclear bombs the energy is obtained by
converting mass to energy.
Example: Calculate the amount of energy that can be obtained from a sample of mass
5 mg when the sample is completely converted to energy.
Solution: m = 2 mg = 2e-3 g; E = ?
E = mc 2 = 2e-3 * 3e8 2 J = 1.8e13 J

b) As speed increases length decreases. A device that is moving with respect to an
object whose length is to be measured measures smaller length than a device that
is at rest with respect to the object. If the length measured by a device at rest with
respect the object is Lo and the length measured by a device moving with a speed
v with respect to the object is L, then
L = Lo √ {1 - (v ⁄ c) 2}
Where c is the speed of light.
Example: Te length of an object as measured by a device at rest with respect to the object
is 2 m. Calculate the length of the object by means of a device moving with a speed of
4e6 m ⁄ s.
Solution: Lo = 2 m; v = 4e6 m ⁄ s; L = ?
L = Lo √ {1 - (v ⁄ c) 2} = 2 * √ {1 - (4e6 ⁄ 3e8) 2} m = 1.99982 m
c)                                                                                           As speed increases time decreases. Te time interval measured by a device moving
with respect to an event is less than the time interval measured by a device at rest
with respect to the event. If to is time interval measured by a device at rest with
respect to the event and t is time interval measured by a device moving with a
speed v with respect to the event, then
t                                                                                            = to √ {1 - (v ⁄ c) 2}
Example: Te time interval for a certain event as measured by a device at rest with respect
to the event is 2000 s. Calculate the time interval as measured by a device moving with
a speed of half of the speed of light with respect to the event.
Solution: to = 2000 s; v = 0.5c; t = ?
t                                                                                            = to √ {1 - (v ⁄ c) 2} = 2000 * √ {1 - (0.5c ⁄ c) 2} s = 1732 s

d) As speed increases, mass increases. A device moving with respect to an object whose
mass is to be measured measures a mass greater than a device at rest with respect
to the object. If the mass measured by a device at rest with respect the object (rest
mass) is mo and the mass measured by a device moving with a speed v with respect
to the object is m, then
m = mo ⁄ √ {1 - (v ⁄ c) 2}
Example: Te rest mass of an object is 3 kg. Calculate its mass measured by a device moving
with 90% of the speed of light.
Solution: mo = 3 s; v = 0.9c; m = ?
m = mo ⁄ √ {1 - (v ⁄ c) 2} = 3 / √ {1 - (0.9c ⁄ c) 2} kg = 6.9 kg

11.3 THE BLACK BODY RADIATION EXPERIMENT
Te black body radiation experiment was done to study the intensity distribution as a
function of wavelength for the radiation emitted by a hot object. Classical physics failed
to explain this experiment. Max Planck was able to explain this experiment based on the
following two postulates:
1. Light is propagated in the form of particles called photons.
2. Te energy of a photon (E) is directly proportional to the frequency (f  ) of the light.
E = hf
Te constant of proportionality, h, is a universal constant called Planck’s constant and its value is
6.6e-34 J ⁄ s.
h = 6.6e-34 J ⁄ s
Te energy of a number of photons is obtained by multiplying the energy of one photon
by the number of photons.
En = nhf
Where n is the number of photons and En is the energy of the n photons. Tese two
postulates led to the emergence of a new kind of physics called quantum physics which is
mainly used at the atomic level.
Example: Calculate the energy of 5000 photons of violet light. Te wavelength of violet
light is 400 nm.
Solution: n = 5000; λ = 400 nm = 400e-9 m = 4e-7 m (f = c ⁄ λ); En = ?
En = nhf = nhc ⁄ λ
E5000 = 5000 * 6.6e-34 * 3e8 ⁄ 4e-7 J = 2.5e-15 J

11.4 THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT EXPERIMENT
When a metallic surface is exposed to light, electrons are emitted from the surface. Tis is
called the photoelectric effect. Te photoelectric effect experiment was done to study the
energy of the emitted electrons. Classical physics predicted that the energy of the emitted
electrons would depend on the intensity of the light. But the photoelectric effect experiment
found out that the energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the light and
not on the intensity of light. Albert Einstein was able to explain this experiment successfully
by making use of Planck’s postulates. According to Einstein, since light is propagated in
the form of particles, it is unlikely for an electron to be hit by more than one photon at
the same time. Tus, the energy of the emitted electrons depends on the energy of one
photon which in turn depends on frequency and not on the number of photons which is
a measure of intensity.
Te minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from a surface is called the
work function (w) of the surface. When a photon hits an electron, some of the energy of
the photon will be used to remove the electron from the surface. Te remaining energy is
converted to the kinetic energy of the emitted electron. Since the most loosely held electron
requires the least amount of energy (which is equal to the work function of the surface),
it will be emitted with the maximum kinetic energy (KEmax). Tus, when the most loosely
electron is hit by light of frequency f, the following equation holds for the most loosely
held electron.
hf = w + KEmax
Example: A metallic surface of work function 2 eV is exposed to violet light. Calculate the
maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons. Wavelength of violet light is 4e-7 m.
Solution: eV (electron Volt) is a unit of energy equal to 1.6e-19 J.
λ = 4e-7 m (f = c ⁄ λ); w = 2 eV = 2 * 1.6e-19 J = 3.2e-19 J; KEmax = ?
f                                                                                                 = c ⁄ λ = 3e8 ⁄ 4e-7 Hz = 7.5e14 Hz
hf = w + KEmax
KEmax = hf - w = (6.6e-34 * 7.5e14 - 3.2e-19) J = 1.7e-19 J

Te photoelectric experiment is a demonstration of the particle property of light because a
single photon as an entity knocks out an electron from the surface of a metal. Te particle
nature of light was further demonstrated by an experiment known as Compton’s effect which
showed that a photon (light) collides with an electron like a particle changing direction
and energy (wavelength) to satisfy the principles of conservation of momentum and energy.
11.5 DE BROGLIE’S HYPOTHESIS
De Broglie’s hypothesis states that if waves have particle properties, then particles also should
have wave properties. De Broglie obtained an expression for the wavelength of particles by
replacing c by speed of a particle v in the equations of light. E = hf = hc ⁄ λ ⇒ E = hv ⁄ λ
and E = mc 2 ⇒ E = mv 2. Equating both expressions of E: mv 2 = mv ⁄ λ. Tus, De Broglie
wavelength of a particle is given as follows:
λ = h ⁄ (mv)

AND MODERN PHYSICS                                                                              Relativity and Quantum Mechanics
Example: Calculate the De Broglie wavelength of an electron (mass 9.1e-31 kg) when moving
with a speed of 5e6 m ⁄ s.
Solution: m = 9.1e-31 kg; v = 5e6 m ⁄ s; λ = ?
λ = h ⁄ (mv) = 6.6e-34 ⁄ (9.1e-31 * 5e6) m = 1.5e-10 m
De Broglie hypothesis was proved to be correct experimentally by two American scientists
by the name Davisson and Germer who proved that electrons have wave properties such
as interference.
11.6 SCHRODINGER’S EQUATION
A scientist by the name Erwin Schrodinger developed an equation for determining the
wave properties of particles. Te equation solves for a function called wave function of the
particle, commonly represented as ψ(x). Te physical meaning of this function was stated
by a scientist by the name Born. Born stated that the square of the wave function (ψ(x)2)
at a given location represents the probability density of locating the particle at the given
location. When the square of a wave function at a given location is multiplied by a small
volume element containing the location (ψ(x)2dx), it represents the probability of locating
the particle at the given location. It follows that in quantum mechanics, we can deduce
only the probability of locating a particle at a certain location and not the exact location.
Te mathematics involved in Schrodinger’s equation is beyond the scope of this treatment.
But, basically, the time independent form of the equation states that the rate of change of
the rate of change of the wave function with respect to position (second derivative of the
wave function with respect to position in the language of calculus) is proportional to the
product of the kinetic energy and the wave function.

11.7 HEISENBERG’S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle states that the position and the momentum of a particle cannot
be determined accurately at the same time. Te lower limit in the uncertainty in measuring
momentum is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in measuring position or vice versa. Tat
is, an uncertainty in measuring one of them sets a lower limit in the uncertainty in measuring
the other. If the uncertainty in measuring position is small (large), then the uncertainty in
measuring momentum will be large (small). In the extreme case where position is measured
accurately (zero uncertainty), the uncertainty in measuring momentum will be infinity. Similarly
if momentum is measured accurately, then the uncertainty in measuring position will be infinity.
Consider a particle whose wave function is a cosine function. It has a unique momentum
because it has a unique wavelength (remember the De Broglie momentum of a particle is
h ⁄ λ). Terefore the uncertainty in measuring momentum is zero. But also a cosine function
extends from negative infinity to positive infinity. Which means the probability of locating
the particle is uniform throughout space. Tis is another way of saying the uncertainty in
measuring position is infinity as predicted by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Te following
is a mathematical statement of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.
ΔxΔp ≥ h ⁄ (4π)
Where Δx and Δp represent uncertainties in measuring position and momentum respectively.
h is Planck’s constant. Tis equation implies that if position is measured with an uncertainty
Δx, then the uncertainty in measuring momentum cannot be less than h ⁄ (4πΔx). Te same
uncertainty relationship holds for the measurements of energy and time.
ΔEΔt ≥ h ⁄ (4π)
Where ΔE and Δt represent the uncertainties in measuring energy and time respectively.

12 ATOMIC PHYSICS
Your goals for this chapter are to learn about the history of the atom, Bohr’s model of the
atom, and electron configuration of the atom.
12.1 THE HISTORY OF THE ATOM
Te atom as the smallest building block of matter was first stated philosophically
(without experimental evidence) by the Greek philosopher Democritus in 460 B.C. But
the first prediction of the existence of the atom based on experimental evidence was made
by John Dalton in the 1800s. Te experimental evidence has largely to do with the fact
that elements combine in definite proportions to form compounds. Te first evidence that
the atom is not the smallest particle but is comprised of smaller particles was obtained by
J.J. Tomson when he discovered the electron in 1897. Since the atom is neutral, Tomson
concluded the atom is made up negative and positive components. Based on this, he
proposed a model of the atom where the atom is a positively charged mesh with electrons
embedded on it uniformly. In 1911, an experiment was done by Ernest Rutherford to study
the structure of the atom. He bombarded a gold foil with alpha particles. An alpha particle
is a positively charge particle which is basically a doubly charged helium atom. To his
surprise, most of the alpha particles passed through the gold foil undeflected. Only a small
portion of them were strongly deflected at certain locations. From this, he concluded, that
the positive component of the atom is located on a very small part of the atom and not all
over the atom as suggested by Tomson. Based on this finding, Rutherford developed an
atomic model known as Rutherford’s atomic model. Rutherford’s atomic model states that
the positive component of the atom is located in a small part of the atom called nucleus
with electrons revolving around the nucleus. But the problem with this model was that
Maxwell’s equations predict that whenever a charge is accelerated, radiation is emitted. Since
motion in a curved path is an accelerated motion, this implies that the electron should be
losing radiation energy continuously and eventually collapse to the nucleus. Also, Maxwell’s
equations predict that, the electron should emit a continuous distribution of frequencies as it
loses energy. But experiment showed that the atomic spectra (radiation emitted by an atom)
contains only few specific frequencies and not a continuous distribution of frequencies. Te
next attempt to improve the atomic model by putting these shortcomings into consideration
was done by Neil’s Bohr in 1912.

12.2 BOHR’S MODEL OF THE ATOM
In addition to the shortcomings of the Rutherford model stated above, Bohr had also to put
into consideration an empirical formula (Rydberg’s formula) for determining the frequencies
of the atomic spectra of hydrogen. Te basic assumptions made by Bohr were:
1. Te electrons revolve only in specific circular orbits and not any orbit. Te
orbits are restricted by the requirement that the angular momentum of the
electron be an integral multiple to the ratio between Planck’s constant and 2π
or h ⁄ (2π). Since angular momentum (for a particle revolving in a circular path)
L = Iw = (mr2)w = m(wr)r = mvr, this condition can be mathematically represented as
mvr = nh ⁄ (2π)

Where m, v and r are the mass of the electron, speed of the electron and the radius of the
orbit respectively. n is an integer. After De Broglie postulated the wavelength of a particle,
this condition turned out to be identical with the condition requiring the circumference of
the circular orbit to be an integral multiple of the wavelength of the electron’s wave. Basically,
this condition states that, the wave has to be a standing wave for the orbit to be an allowed
orbit. According to De Broglie, mv = h ⁄ λ. Terefore mvr = hr ⁄ λ. Equating this with nh ⁄
(2π) gives Bohr’s condition in terms of the De Broglie’s wavelength of the electron.
2πr = nλ
2. When an electron jumps from one orbit to another, radiation is emitted (absorbed) whose
energy is equal to the difference between the energies of both orbits. Te frequency of
the radiation is obtained according to Planck’s law (E = hf).
ΔE = hf
Where ΔE is the difference between the energies of the orbits and f is the frequency of
the radiation emitted (absorbed).
12.2.1 APPLICATION OF BOHR’S MODEL TO THE HYDROGEN ATOM
Bohr used classical physics to obtain the energy of the electron in an orbit. Te total energy
of an electron in an orbit is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. Te kinetic energy
is mvn2 ⁄ 2, where vn is the speed of the electron in the nth orbit. Te dominant force between
the proton and the electron of the hydrogen atom is electrical. Terefore the potential energy
is electrical potential energy and is given by -ke2 ⁄ rn, where e stands for the charge of the
electron and rn stands for the radius of the nth orbit. Terefore the energy of the nth orbit
is given by E = mvn2 ⁄ 2 - ke2 ⁄ rn. Te Energy can be expressed as a function of the radius
only by substituting for the speed in terms of the radius by using Newton’s second law for
circular motion (centripetal force = electrical force or mvn2 ⁄ rn = ke2 ⁄ rn2).
En = -ke2 ⁄ (2rn)
Te radius may be expressed interns of the orbit number, n, by substituting for speed in
Newton’s second law for circular motion (mvn2 ⁄ rn = ke2 ⁄ rn2) in terms of n using Bohr’s
condition for angular momentum (mvr = nh ⁄ (2π)).
rn = [h2 ⁄ (4π2mke2)]n2

rn may also be expressed in terms of the lowest radius, r1, because r1 = h2 ⁄ (4π2mke2) which
is the coefficient of n2.
rn = r1n2
Te allowed orbit radius varies in direct proportion to the square of the orbit number.
For example the radius of the second orbit is four times the radius of the first orbit.
With m = 9.1e-31 kg, h = 6.6e-34 Js, k = 9e9 N2m2 ⁄ C2, and e = 1.6e-19 C, the lowest
radius of the hydrogen atom can be calculated to be
r1 = 5.3e-11 m
Te energy can be expressed as a function of the orbit number by substituting for the radius
in terms of the orbit number n.
En = [-2π2mk2e4 ⁄ h2] ⁄ n2
Te coefficient of 1 ⁄ n2 is equal to the energy of the first orbit. (E1 = -2π2mk2e4 ⁄ h2)
En = E1 ⁄ n2
Te energy of the allowed orbits varies inversely with the square of the orbit number. For
example the energy of the second orbit is one fourth of that of the first orbit. Te value of
the energy of the lowest orbit turns out to be 13.6 eV (remember eV = 1.6e-19 J)
E1 = -13.6 eV
Example: For the third orbit of the hydrogen atom
a) calculate the radius.

b) calculate the energy.
Solution: n = 3; E3 = ?
En = E1 ⁄ n2
E3 = -13.6 ⁄ 32 eV = -1.511 eV
Te lowest orbit corresponding to n = 1 is called the ground state. Tis is the orbit where the
electron of the hydrogen atom resides under normal conditions. Te electron can jump to a
higher orbit by absorbing energy and it can drop from a higher to a lower orbit by emitting
energy (radiation). According to Bohr, the emitted energy is equal to the difference between
the energies of the orbits. Suppose an electron drops from an orbit whose orbit number
is ni to an orbit whose orbit number is nf. Ten ΔE = Ef - Ei = hf = hc ⁄ λ (using c = fλ).
Replacing the energies with their expressions in terms of their respective orbit numbers, the
following expression for the wavelength of the emitted radiation can be obtained.
1 ⁄ λ = R(1 ⁄ nf2 - 1 ⁄ ni2)

Where R = 2π2mk2e4 ⁄ ch3 and is called Rydberg’s constant. Tis formula turned out to be
exactly the same with a formula (Rydberg’s formula) known earlier empirically. Te numerical
value of Rydberg’s constant is
R = 1.097e7 m-1
Te set of radiations emitted when an electron drops from higher orbits to the second orbit
is called the Balmer series; and the set of radiations emitted when the electron drops from
higher orbits to the first orbit is called the Lyman series.
Example: Calculate the wavelength of the light emitted when the electron of a hydrogen
atom drops from the fourth orbit to the second orbit.
Solution: ni = 4; nf = 2; λ = ?
1 ⁄ λ = R(1 ⁄ nf2 - 1 ⁄ ni2)
1 ⁄ λ = 1.097e7 * (1 ⁄ 22 - 1 ⁄ 42) = 2.06e6 m-1
λ = 4.86e-7 m
After some spectra that cannot be explained by the Bohr model were discovered, it became
very clear that the orbit number cannot account for all of the states of the hydrogen atom.
Also, even though the Bohr model was successful with the hydrogen atom, it failed when
applied to more complex atoms. According to the current understanding, the state of an
electron is identified by four numbers including Bohr’s orbit number. Tese numbers are
called quantum numbers.

12.3 QUANTUM NUMBERS
Quantum numbers are numbers used to identify the state of an electron in an atom. Tere
are four quantum numbers. Tese are known as the n, l, m and s quantum numbers.
1.                                                                                               Te n-quantum number, also known ad the principal quantum number (Tis is also
the orbit number in Bohr’s model). It represents the energy of the electron. Te
allowed values of n start from 1 and increase in steps of one: n = 1, 2, 3, …
2.                                                                                               Te l-quantum number, also known as the angular momentum quantum number. It
represents the angular momentum of the electron. For a given n-quantum number,
the allowed l-quantum numbers go from 0 to n - 1 in steps of one: l = 0, 1, 2, …
n-1. Tat is, for a given n there are n possible l values. For example, the allowed
values of l for n = 3 are 0, 1, and 2. Te l-quantum numbers are customarily
represented by letter names. Te l-quantum numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 are respectively
represented by the letter names s, p, d, and f.
3.                                                                                               Te m-quantum number, also known as the magnetic quantum number (because
it manifests itself in the presence of magnetic field). It represents the orientation
of the angular momentum of the electron. For a given l-quantum number, the
allowed values of m go from -l to l in steps one: m = -l, …-, 2,-1, 0, 1, 2, …, l.
Tat is, for a given l, there are 2l + 1 possible m values. For example, the allowed
values of m for l = 2 are, -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.
4.                                                                                               Te s-quantum number, also known as the spin quantum number. It represents an
intrinsic angular momentum of the electron. It is sometimes referred as the angular
momentum related with the rotation of the electron around it’s axis even though
there is no evidence of it being related with the motion of the electron. For a given
m-quantum number there are two possible s-quantum numbers identified as -1⁄ 2
and 1 ⁄ 2: s = -1⁄ 2, 1 ⁄ 2.
Since there are                                                                                  (2l                                                                            + 1) possible m-quantum numbers for a given l-quantum number
and there are two spin quantum numbers for each magnetic quantum number, there are
2(2l + 1) possible states for a given l-quantum number. For example for l = 3, there are
2(2 * 3 + 1) = 14 possible states. And since there are n l-quantum numbers for a given
n-quantum number, there are 2n2 possible states corresponding to a given n-quantum number.
For example, there are 2 * 22 = 8 possible states corresponding to the n = 2 quantum number.
Along with a principle called the Pauli exclusion principle, quantum numbers can be used
to determine the electron configuration of atoms. Pauli exclusion principle states that no two
electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. Tis implies that there is a one-to-
one correspondence between the set of quantum numbers and the electrons of the atom.

ELECTRICITY, MAGNETISM, OPTICS
AND MODERN PHYSICS                                                                              Atomic Physics
12.3.1 ELECTRON CONFIGURATION
Electron configuration is the arrangement of the electrons in an atom according to their
quantum numbers. Electrons with the same n-quantum number are said to form a shell. And
electrons with the same n and l-quantum numbers are said to form a subshell. Te electrons
in a subshell are symbolically represented as xyz. x stands for the n-quantum number of the
subshell. y stands for the letter name of the l-quantum number of the subshell. z represents
the number of electrons in the subshell. For example, consider the subshell represented
as 3p4. Its principal and angular momentum quantum numbers are 3 and 1 respectively;
and it contains four electrons. It is not completely filled because the maximum number of
electrons a p-subshell can accommodate is six.
Te subshells of an atom are filled with electrons in an increasing order of their energies.
Tis can be accomplished by filling the electrons in an increasing order of the value of
(n + l) of the subshells. If two or more subshells have the same (n + l) value, they are
filled in an increasing order of n. For example, 4s subshell is filled before the 3d subshell
because n + l is equal to 4 for 4s and 5 for 3d; and 2p subshell is filled before 3s subshell
even though both of them have the same n + l = 3 value, because 2p subshell has a lower
principal quantum number than the 3s subshell. Te following is an arrangement of the
subshells according to these rules:
1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s24f145d106p67s25f146d107p6
Te number of electrons shown is the maximum number of electrons the subshell can
accommodate. Te maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in s, p, d,
and f subshells are 2, 6, 10 and 14 respectively.
Example: Write the electron configuration of the first 10 elements of the periodic table (H,
He, Li, Be, B, O, N, F, and Ne) whose number of electrons range from one to ten.
Solution: Te electrons are filled according to the order of filling of the subshells shown
above. Respectively, their electron configurations are:
1s1,1s2, 1s22s1, 1s22s2, 1s22s22p1, 1s22s22p2, 1s22s22p3, 1s22s22p4, 1s22s22p5, 1s22s22p6

Te electron configurations can be used to explain the periodic table. Te periodic table is
an arrangement of the elements according to their properties. Te periodic table is periodic
in a sense that similar properties repeat as the principal quantum number increases. It is
not periodic in a sense that similar properties repeat in equal intervals. Te properties
of the elements depend on the highest energy subshell (the last subshell in the electron
configuration) and the number of electrons in this subshell. When the elements are grouped
in such a way that elements with the same highest energy subshell and the same number
of electrons in their highest energy subshell are grouped together, the result is the periodic
table of the elements. For example the elements, Hydrogen, Lithium, Sodium, Potassium,
Rubidium, Cesium and Francium are grouped together in the periodic table because they
all have an s-subshell with one electron as their highest energy subshell or last subshell in
their electron configuration.

13 NUCLEAR PHYSICS
Your goals for the chapter are to learn about the nucleus of the atom, radio activity, binding
energy, and nuclear reactions.
Te nucleus as the positively charged component of the atom occupying a very small
volume of the atom, was discovered by Rutherford. Te radiation (alpha particles) that
Rutherford used to bombard a gold foil which enabled him to discover the nucleus was
actually radiation emitted by a nucleus. Tis radiation was discovered earlier by Becquerel
and is known as radio activity. Later it was discovered that the nucleus is made of two kinds
of particles known as a proton and a neutron. Te proton has a mass of about 1837 times
the mass of the electron. Te proton is positively charged with a charge numerically equal
to that of the electron (1.6e-19 C). Te neutron has about the same mass as a proton and
does not have a charge. Te number of protons of an atom is called the atomic number
of the atom. Te sum of the number of protons and number of neutrons of an atom is
called the mass number of the atom. Since the atom is neutral, the number of electrons is
equal to the number of protons. In nuclear physics an element whose atomic number is
Z and whose mass number is A is symbolically represented as AXZ where X is the chemical
symbol of the element. For example the symbol 23Na11 is a representation of sodium atom
with atomic number 11 and mass number 23.
Te identity of an atom (what makes it a unique element) is determined by its atomic
number. Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass number (that is, same
number of protons but different number of neutrons) are said to be different isotopes of the
same element. When electrons are bombarded into atoms, they will be decelerated because
of the electrical force exerted by the nucleus. Because of the deceleration, the electrons emit
radiation known as x-rays. Some of these rays called characteristic rays (rays produced when
an electron in the inner shell is knocked out), turned out to be finger prints of the element
(that is, the characteristic ray was uniquely related with the element being bombarded). Te
fact that this radiation was also found out to be related uniquely with the atomic number
of the element, established the fact that the uniqueness of an element is directly related
with its atomic number and not mass number (atomic weight) as previously thought. Tis
realization helped resolve some discrepancies in the periodic table.

13.1 RADIO ACTIVITY
Radio activity is the decay of an atom when its nucleus decays by emitting three kinds of
particles spontaneously. Tese particles are known as alpha, beta and gamma particles. An
alpha particle is essentially a doubly charged Helium ion. It consists of two protons and
two neutrons. A beta particle is an electron. A gamma particle is a photon. When a nucleus
emits an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by two and it’s mass number decreases
by four (ZXA → Z-2YA-4 + 2He4). Since this process changes the atomic number, the element
is converted into another kind of element. During a beta emission, a neutron becomes a
proton and the atomic number increases by one while the mass number remains the same
(ZXA → Z+1YA + e-). Since the atomic number changes during this process, the end product
will be a different kind of element. A gamma emission occurs when a nucleus falls from
an excited state to a lower state. Tis does not change the atomic or mass number and
the element remains the same element (ZXA →
ZXA + γ). Gamma radiation is the most
energetic radiation.

AND MODERN PHYSICS                                                                                        Nuclear Physics
Te decay of a radioactive atom by emitting radiation is spontaneous. Tis means it is
impossible to predict whether a certain atom will decay or not at a particular instant of time.
But the probability that a certain atom might decay at a given instant of time is a constant
for a given radioactive element. As an analogy, consider flipping of a coin. Even though it is
impossible to predict whether the outcome will be a head or tail, the probability of getting
a head is a constant which is 1 ⁄ 2. But if a large number of coins are tossed at the same
time, it is possible to predict that about half of them will be heads. Similarly, if there are a
large number of radioactive atoms, it is possible to predict the fraction of atoms that will
decay (which should be equal to the probability) at a given instant of time. Another way
of saying this is the number of particles that decay at a given instant of time (decay rate) is
proportional to the number of radioactive atoms present. As atoms of a given sample keep
decaying, the number of atoms available for radio activity decreases. Using the language of
calculus, this relationship may be expresses as dN ⁄ dt = -λN where N stands for the number
of atoms available for decay at an arbitrary time t; and λ is a constant called decay constant.
Te methods of calculus can be used to show that the number of atoms available for decay
decreases exponentially with the base being the natural number e = 2.718.
N = No e-λt
Where No is the number of radioactive atoms at t = 0. Te SI unit of decay rate which is
number of decay per second is defined to be the Becquerel, abbreviated as Bq. Te time
interval during which the number of atoms available for decay decreases to half of the initial
number of atoms is called the half-life (τ) of the decay: No ⁄ 2 = No e-λτ or e-λτ = 1 ⁄ 2 or
λτ = ln (2). Terefore the half-life as a function of the decay constant is given as
τ = ln (2) ⁄ λ = 0.693 ⁄ λ
Example: 53I132 has a half-life of 2.3 hours. Initially a sample of this iodine isotope has 2e20 atoms.
a) Calculate it’s decay constant.
Solution: τ = 2.3 hr = 8280 s; λ = ?
τ = 0.693 ⁄ λ
λ = 0.693 ⁄ τ = 0.693 ⁄ 8280 s-1 = 8.37e-5 s-1

b) Calculate the number of iodine that have not decayed yet after one day.
Solution: No = 2e20; t = 1 day = 86400 s; N = ?
N = No e-λt
= 2e20 * e-(8.37e-5 * 86400) = 1.45e17
13.2 BINDING ENERGY
As stated above, a nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Te mass of the protons
and neutrons taken as free individual particles is greater than the mass of the nucleus.
When protons and neutrons are combined together to form a nucleus, the difference in
mass is released as energy according to Einstein’s formula E = mc2. Tis energy is also the
amount of energy needed to break the nucleus into its component protons and neutrons
and is called the binding energy of the nucleus. Suppose a nucleus of a certain element x
has mass mx and contains Np protons and Nn neutrons. Ten the binding energy Eb of the
nucleus is given by
Eb = (Npmp + Nnmn - mx)c2
Where mp = 1.6726e-27 kg is the mass of the proton, mn = 1.6750e-27 kg is the mass of
the neutron and c = 3e8 m ⁄ s is the speed of light. A common unit of mass in nuclear
physics is the atomic mass unit (u) which is equal to 1.6605e-27 kg. A common unit of
energy in nuclear physics is the electron volt (eV) which is equal to 1.6e-19 J.
Example: Te mass of an alpha particle is 4.00153 u. Calculate it’s binding energy in eV.
Solution: An alpha particle has two protons and two neutrons.
Np = 2; Nn = 2; mα = 4.00153 u = 4.00153 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 6.6445e-27 kg; Eb = ?
Eb = (Npmp + Nnmn - mα)c2
= (2 * 1.6726e-27 + 2 * 1.6750e-27 - 6.7446e-27) * 3e82 J
= 4.563e-12 J
= 4.563e-12 ⁄ 1.6e-19 eV = 2.852e7 eV

13.3 NUCLEAR REACTIONS
A nuclear reaction is a process by which two nuclei collide to create different kind of nuclei
or nucleus. During a nuclear reaction, in addition to energy and momentum, the atomic
number and the mass number should be conserved. Tat is, the sum of atomic numbers
before the reaction should be equal to the sum of atomic numbers after the reaction; and
the sum of mass numbers before the reaction should be equal to the sum of mass numbers
after the reaction. In other words, the number of protons and neutrons is conserved. Binding
energy increases in reactions that release energy and decreased in reactions that absorb
energy. A reaction in which energy is released is called exothermic reaction. A reaction in
which energy is absorbed is called endothermic reaction.
A reaction in which two nuclei react to produce a single nucleus is called fusion. A reaction
in which a nucleus breaks down into smaller nuclei is called fission. Te binding energy of
the nuclei increases as atomic number increases up until atomic number 62. Beyond atomic
number 62 the binding energy of the atoms decreases as the atomic number increases. For
reactions that release energy involving smaller (below atomic number 62) nuclei, fusion is
more likely because bigger nuclei in this range have more binding energy. For reactions
that release energy involving heavy (above atomic number 62) nuclei, fission is more likely
because smaller nuclei in this range have more binding energy.
